# Rizal Sa Dapitan Notes

```toc
min depth: 1
```

## Opening
- presumably right after rizal gets shot
- buried in a grave, carried by civil guard?
- teodora asking the warden where he is buried
- switches towards when Rizal was alive and he was exiled to Dapitan
	- upon arrival in the major general 
- he was given the choice of staying under the church (padre oba) or under  the commandant of the politico-militar (capitan ricardo carnicero) of dapitan.
	- oba guy hated him so bad, basically removed the choice of staying under the church
	- Rizal grows close with Carnicero, and grows fond of his sentiments for reform for the filipinos
	- Carnicero notes however that the friar’s influence are too strong in the country.
- became community doctor, opened community clinic (free, whatever charity they can give)
- Priest Francisco de Paula Sanchez visits him

## Second
- showcases his winning of lottery
- bought talisay
- showcases him trying to create his home in talisay
- this guy Sanchez still tryna convert J Rizzler but was sent back to manila 
- J Rizzler was teaching students, opened a mini school too

## Third
- His mother and sisters arrive after much bargaining wih the gobernador heneral
- they bring news of leonor’s death
- cure mother eye
- j Rizzler dad dying, mother go back
- Josephine Bracken
- josephine almost gets molested (details on how she was often molested by uncle)
	- probably cared for by Rizal due to her situation
	- Rizzler probably already knew this, hence his decision to try and marry her
		- does not really love her, just wants to free her from this burden. (my opinion)

## Four
- topher dies lmaoooooooooooooo
- J Bracken leaves for funeral
- Florencio Namanan
	- sent by friars as spy, however 
- marriage denied by oba
