# Political Activism in Families During the Marcos Dictatorship
mapping childhood agency and intergenerational continuity

- research of mary grace r. concepcion
- identified the narratives are from point of view of activists
	- studied and interviewed children of activists (now adults) who experienced childhood under martial law

## Questions asked in interviews
- impressions of martial law
- perceived threats
- family dynamics
- perception of family members
- how interviewee coped with struggles during martial law
- acts of subversion as a child

## Related Literature
- Children in Social Movements: Rethinking Agency, Mobilization and Rights
- Authored by Diane M Rodgers, published by Routledge 2020
- identifies 3 involvements of children in social movements
	- children as strategic participants
		- brought by parents to act as symbols of political repression and oppression
	- children as participants by default
		- dr concepcion discusses this in the conference
		- brought by parents into political activity for convenience
	- children as active participants
		- greta thunberg

- these children experienced political persecution which affected the family
- in these cases, it was not just merely parents bringing children to political events, rather, state intrusion disrupted private and family lives.

## descriptions of children of growing up during the marcos dictatorship
- according to ***two*** interviewees (yikes?)
	- Kris Lacaba
	- JL Burgos
- shrouded in secrecy
	- protects family and child as well (?)
	- the adults explaining the situation was based on the child’s understanding and potential to unintentionally reveal details
		- not everything was disclosed
	- not everything could be revealed to other people, such as contrasting perspectives on PH history because other people will not understand.
- family dynamics in surviving and resisting political persecution
- attempts to “normalize” childhood
- depends on the severity of torture and imprisonment, and the specific social environment during martial law 
	- two variations, early dictatorship vs late dictatorship

## recollections and impressions of martial law
- disembodied memories
- no memory that is not martial law because child was born during martial law
- Ninoy Aquino assassination was a big event because people were talking about it.

##  JL Burgos
- child of Jose Burgos Jr. and Edith Burgos
	- couple ran WE Forum in 1977 and *Ang Pahayagang Malaya* in 1983, also known as the “mosquito press” 
- eight years old when father was imprisoned for one week for journalistic activities in 1982
- grew up in the news office and printing press so therefore knew current events and important events
- buddy system among the family, family council
- mostly remembers the 1980s after father’s arrest
### attempts to “normalize” childhood
- the family did not explain that the political situation was dangerous
- trying to have a normal childhood such as playing, celebrating holidays. Fond memories of playing and hanging out in the news office
- since there was no point of comparison, he perceived the social environment as normal. Did not understand what was political.
### acts of subversion as a child
- during court litigation of father, he challenged the soldier “Bakit, tuta ka ba ni Marcos?” when he was prevented to go near father.

### Perception of Father’s imprisonment
- Kris Lacaba - father did not do anything wrong, no charges filed against him, and other people have suffered the same fate
- JL Burgos - older siblings explained the reason for father’s arrest. Father was arrested because Marcos did not like what he wrote in the newspaper.

## Current researches and projects (of children)
- Kris Lacaba - writes articles about the period, researches about the Human Rights Situation, Hawaii Class Suit and the Rights Claims
	- situates the family’s story as part of the bigger narrative of Philippine history
- JL Burgos - recounts family story in film documentary *Portraits of a Mosquito Press* 
	- shares the same nationalistic principles of the father

## Conclusion
- Political perception and involvement of children from activist families
- notions of secrecy, family involvement in anti-Marcos dictatorship struggle
- Methods of protecting children by withholding information or framing information to be understood by children
- early martial law vs late martial law, severity of torture and nature of imprisonment
## Suggestions
- explore perspective of children who were targets of state violence in communities during Martial Law, and not just from middle class families.
- The importance of families as a locus of political activity.


# Documenting Memories: The Select Narratives of the Local Residents of Molave, Zamboanga del Sur during Martial Law years (1972 - 1981)
- professors Jed B Otano, Marjorie Almario-Magdadaro, 
- researchers Elmar B Albios, Vicksel Jane Tamayo

## Introduction
- The untold narratives are equally important to learn and avoid mistakes of the past
- for $location, civilians were greatly affected.
- the documentation of historical experiences from the lens of key informants who carry lived experiences allows 
	- speaking and sharing struggles and triumphs
	- campaign of raising historical awareness
	- challenge historical revisionism for personal and political interests

## Research Problem
- what were significant events, perceived issues, and conflict-incidents during the Martial Law in Molave?
- how did the residents of molave respond to the declaration of martial law and its resulting conflict-incidents

## Methodology
- descriptive-narrative writing and oral historiography
- 43 key informants
	- informants are familiar with the local history of Molave
	- long time local resident
	- personal and direct experience of Martial Law period in the Municipality
	- key informants include
		- one former NPA member
		- one former civil legal team member
		- one former ICHDF member
		- one former PH army master sergeant 
		- former barangay captains and councilors
		- two municipal mayors
		- among others
- resulting violations and abuses
- needed/desired compensation & rehabilitation
	- as drawn from the informants

## Results and Discussions - Pre Martial Law Years: Molave’s Peace and Order
- Personal Accounts
- “In our time before ML, going home late in the evening or dawn from social gatherings is safe and no troubles”
- “very peaceful, normal situation, sometimes crime but very peculiar, election is not chaotic because no vote buying, local candidates and food for the supporters”

## Participation and Role of Locals
- some locals were directly involved in the Communist Party, there being a legal team and police agents infiltrating
- communal gardens became gathering places for NPA seminars
- NPA promised the people a new form of government for the oppressed people and land owners
- the NPA asked for food, civilians obey hesitantly because military cracks down on suspicion of subversion

## Case of Killings
- civilians who supported the government were killed by the NPA
- civilians also killed NPA
- military killed gigatons of NPA

## Sexual and Physical Abuses
- soldiers abuse locals (S&A)
- no retaliation because of fear
- locals were tortured for information regarding the NPA (civilians, not actually NPA)

## Looting
- military loots the locals
- NPA and locals starve

## Incident Response
- no compensation nor acknowledgement from government
- victims were silenced, no investigation nor justice
- confrontations of NPA and military resulted in local mass evacuations

## Conclusion & Recommendation
- the municipality entered its “darkest part of history” when it became a “killing field” because of killings committed by NPA and military forces, as well as the abuses of military.
- the writing and retelling of these local narratives are very critical in post-conflict reconstruction efforts, especially in the context of transitional justice in congruence with the challenges brought by historical distortion.


# Martial Law through the Lens of the(??) OPM Rock: A historical and thematic analysis
- authored by hermenio b cabusog jr
- it is very straightforward.
	- but the presentation barely made sense
	- he just presents it as fact, i cannot criticize how he made up those relationships between lyrics
- the study is basically word soup from all opm songs

## Selection of Data 
- data gathered from A-Z lyrics
- OPM rock lyrics published / performed between 1970 - 1989 OPM rock bands
- songs whose lyrics are not available will not be included D:

## the entire research
- basically analysis of phrases, sentences
- frequent sentences are related to others
- basically a trend analysis of messages of songs

## Conclusion
- findings showed that the artists adopted the demands and trends of time as implied through the lyrics of songs
- OPM Rock Songs manifested on the lyrics reflected the evolution and polarity of sentiments of different versions(???) of the Marcos Martial Law Era in the series of points in time from 70s to 80s
- polarity of the ML™ experience (??) of 70s-80s still reverberates today (proof?)

# JPaul Manzanilla
- comments & questions for the pannel
## # Political Activism in Families During the Marcos Dictatorshi
- challenge of isolated individual memories
	- basically the fact that there are only 2 interviewees
- do children automatically carry the convictions of their parents
- process of accepting the obligation to continue or be a legacy to their parents
- in studies of memory, concepcion conceptualized the term post memory, memory of revolutionaries’ children
	- did not experience the oppression (the study itself showed that the children themselves also experienced oppression, just not exactly the same as that of the parents)  of the revolutionary but the memories were passed onto them
- privilege (?? what)
- difficulty of transforming memory into history
### response by concepcion
- admits the challenge of isolated memories (not representative of a group and may be easily dismissed)
- “*do children automatically carry the convictions of their parents?*”
	- her presentation was part of a bigger study where other children (grown up and young) were also interviewed 
		- hence early ML vs late ML experience
	- some of the interviewees would relate that siblings harbor resentment to parents (due to the difficulties of growing up where parents are just going to jail, notions of secrecy, “*not normal*” childhood, etc)

## Documenting Memories: The Select Narratives of the Local Residents of Molave, Zamboanga del Sur during Martial Law years (1972 - 1981)
- how to reconcile positive memory of martial law to negative
- the study involves the ideal victim, wherein the victim (civilians) does not support any faction
	- if the victim decides to support the rebel group, their deaths are easily justified.
### response by albios
- a preliminary study to be scaled to a national level (in response to first question)
- supposed to combat historical distortion

## Martial Law through the Lens of the(??) OPM Rock: A historical and thematic analysis
- what about different genres?
- explore the relevance of music / audio and memory
- OPM is dominated by tagalog, what about localized songs? adaptations into local language?


# Open Forum
## from moderator Nicole Aboitiz
- intergenerational continuity from the side of the supporters of Marcos and the Marcos Family
	- sociology of said support intergenerationally (in contrast with revolutionaries’ children)
	- particularly with how it influenced the people that voted Ferdinand “BongBong” Marcos Jr. to presidency
### response from Concepcion
- did not answer the question, instead discusses how the stories of revolutionaries becomes a catalyst in a desire for change in present generations, where today protesters roam around the country to give talks about the atrocities of the Marcos regime.
