# Rizal’s annotations on Morga’s History record (of the Philippines?)

```toc
```


## Recap
- pre-colonial Philippine politics and laws
	- discussion of heirarchical, political structure and engagement with neighboring islands and even countries by local leaders
		- leaders are nobility

## Law and Enforcement
- laws are made based on agreements
	- this implies uniformity and strong relations among the islanders
	- this also disproves the ascribed barbarity of the locals
- social status was inherited from parents
	- some are also degenerated and assigned to a lower social stratification based on assumed crimes
	- this gives insight into the morality of the pre-colonial locals
 - enforcement and adherence to these laws further demonstrate the degree of complexity in communities
	 - Rizal refers to a custom law that is obeyed by the locals, it is not written in anywhere
		 - this then implies a high degree of morality and thinking due to written law being avoidable, however the custom law was respected despite not being written.
- Rizal describes the indio to have learned the traditions of his people by heart since childhood.
	- he compares this to the laws of his time, where wise laws where written but the people neither know or understand them
	- he also describes these laws to be alien to the individual, and becomes moot at the individuals’s whim.
 - Rizal discusses the normative distinction between rigorous and tyrannical laws of the spanish colonial invasion which was truly unjust for the Indio and more so for the chinese settlers.
	 - the law in the philippines was more predatory against the chinese
	 - to demonstrate the unjust laws of the spanish invaders, rizal points out the rights of the “free half” of a part slave (in the precolonial society).
		- because the free half had the rights of a freeman, it proves that the laws were not tyrannical despite being rigorous. 
		-  
	 - The spanish grouped the chinese settlers into “China towns”
	 - Rizal points out the intricacies of precolonial law, which gave even slaves rights in a stratified society.
		 - this further demonstrates the quality of morality the locals possessed, against the accusations of colonial invaders.

### Third Party Enforcement
- judges were persons of the locality forming a jury, elected by both parties who knew and understood the case
	- the customs and usages (according to rizal) are better than that of a gowned judge who judges for money.
	- the judge will not understand the customs and laws of the locality
		- rizal discusses this to be “backward” due to the multitude of “contradictory” laws and royal orders
	- the discontent of both parties who seek justice now resort to the Supereme Court of Spain (if they can afford a 36 day trip)
		- where the judges are more hoest and incorruptible, if not better informed about the country.
	- this causes cases to last an eternity, handed down to several generations before being resolved.o
- Rizal is not the first to describe the state of justice and law enforcement in the PH
	- MacMicking who was neither PH nor SPN, talks about the “*dilatoriness*” of the law in the colony and documents his observations on the inefficiency of enforcement
- While Rizal does not discredit the disparity of precolonial law rulings, he compares this to the parish priest who has the sole proprietor of status and power (due to his position) 
	- the priest then dishes out rulings based on his whim, and also based on the reputation of those that approach the priest.
	- he details that despite
## Pre-Hispanic Phillipine trade
### Trade relations with Asia
- in the late 10th century, the Ma-yi polity appears in Chinese texts in relation to the polity’s part in the lucrative trade with the Chinese.
	- The first mention was in 917 AD
- Rizal notes how the Spanish colonization came to reconfigure precolonial trade patterns
	- Spanish colonization drastically reduced the PH’s potential role in Asiatic trade, modifying the economic dynamics of the PH both domestically and internationally
	- PH stopped participation as *”entrepot”* on the trade route whose two termini were the Mediterranean and the Middle East on one end and China on the other
 - these might be the precious ancient
- The excavation of 9th to 10th century Asian ceramics in Cebu demonstrates an extensive involvement in foreign trade
	- by the time of Spanish contact, Cebu ranked as one of the largest (if not the largest) port trader.
	- controlled by the Cebu Chief, implying a measure of control over trade goods in and out of the port, constituting an important geopolitical currency in negotiations
	- precious ancient jars in Rizal’s footnotes are exceptions to the record of PH exports
		- Why is this still important given that the local origin of manufacture is contested?
