## What is a Neural Network
- basta you already know wtf it is

## Supervised Learning
- given inputs `[i,j,k]` as training data, neural network is expected to predict feature `l`
- then given input `x = [a,b,c]`, as evaluation data, nn is expected to predict feature `y` 
- much harder for NN's to make sense of unstructured data such as:
	- image, text, sound
- compared to structured data like tables with rows and columns

## Matrix  Multiplication (FAST)
