Creating a Quantum Deep Neural Network (QDNN) involves the integration of quantum computing principles with the structure of a deep neural network. Here are some steps to create a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN), a type of QDNN¹:

1. **Setup**: Install the necessary libraries such as TensorFlow and TensorFlow Quantum¹.
```python
pip install tensorflow==2.7.0
pip install tensorflow-quantum==0.7.2
```
2. **Import Dependencies**: Import the necessary modules¹.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_quantum as tfq
import cirq
import sympy
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from cirq.contrib.svg import SVGCircuit
```
3. **Build a QCNN**: Assemble circuits in a TensorFlow graph¹. You can use the `tfq.layers.AddCircuit` layer for in-graph circuit construction¹.
```python
qubit = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)
circuit1 = cirq.Circuit(cirq.X(qubit))
circuit2 = cirq.Circuit(cirq.H(qubit))
input_circuit_tensor = tfq.convert_to_tensor([circuit1, circuit2])
y_circuit = cirq.Circuit(cirq.Y(qubit))
y_appender = tfq.layers.AddCircuit()
output_circuit_tensor = y_appender(input_circuit_tensor, append=y_circuit)
```
4. **Training**: The training of these networks happens in optimization algorithms².

Please note that this is a simplified example. The actual implementation of a QCNN or any QDNN would be more complex and would require a good understanding of both quantum computing and deep learning¹²³⁴⁵. It's also important to note that you would need a quantum computer or a quantum simulator to run these networks¹²³⁴⁵.
