	- Roads are an essential part of infrastructure and traffic that flows through them determines the economic growth of a country. 
	- Traffic studies are important for acquiring knowledge about vehicular flow characteristics. Information obtained through these studies assists in building efficient road facilities and to avoid traffic jams with reduction in travel time. 
	- With urbanization and corresponding increase in number of vehicles in metropolitan as well as suburban cities, problem related to traffic congestion is increasing day by day.
	- In rapid developing countries like India, where less attention has been paid to transportation sector and due to mixed traffic, traffic congestion problem is becoming a major challenge for administrators and planners. Indian cities face traffic problems characterized by levels of congestion, noise and air pollution, traffic fatalities and injuries.
	- transport crisis due to extreme rapid growth of larger and medium cities with low income, limited and outdated transport infrastructure, rampant suburban sprawl (settlers?), sharply rising motor vehicle ownership and use, deteriorating bus services, a wider range of motorized and non-motorized (walking, biking) transport modes sharing roadways, inadequate and uncoordinated land use and transport planning
	-  Due to stochastic nature of traffic flow and highly nonlinear characteristics for short term prediction, artificial inteligence techniques have received much attention and are considered as an alternative for traffic flow prediction model.

Overview of Short Term Traffic Forecasting

Traffic management and control are essential components of urban planning and transportation systems. In this overview, we will explore the motivations behind traffic forecasting and the approaches employed for effective traffic management and control. This includes considerations in both developing and developed countries, where strategies like Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), congestion pricing policies, and adaptive traffic signaling are used to enhance traffic flow and reduce congestion.

Traffic forecasting plays a pivotal role in informed decision-making regarding infrastructure development, resource allocation, and traffic regulation. It allows authorities to anticipate congestion, make data-driven decisions, and implement measures to prevent or mitigate traffic issues.

  

In both developing and developed countries, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are pivotal in improving traffic management. ITS incorporates technologies like traffic monitoring, traffic signal control, and information dissemination, all aimed at enhancing transportation safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Moreover, policies such as congestion pricing are implemented in various regions to manage traffic by charging vehicles for using specific roadways or areas during peak hours. Additionally, traffic signaling systems are becoming more adaptive, adjusting signal timings in real-time to optimize traffic flow, while route changes and diversions can be employed to alleviate congestion. Traffic forecasting is fundamental in guiding decisions related to infrastructure development, resource allocation, and traffic regulation. It provides valuable insights to authorities, enabling them to anticipate congestion, thus facilitating proactive measures in traffic management and control.

  

Traffic forecasting can be classified into two main categories: long-term and short-term forecasts. Long-term traffic forecasting involves predicting traffic patterns over extended periods, typically spanning several years, and is used for long-range urban planning and infrastructure development. In contrast, short-term traffic forecasting focuses on predicting traffic conditions over shorter horizons, often within minutes to a few hours ahead, facilitating real-time traffic management and decision-making.

  

Short-term traffic forecasting can be approached in three distinct ways:

1. Model-Based: This approach relies on mathematical models and algorithms that consider historical data, weather conditions, traffic flow patterns, and other relevant factors to make predictions about short-term traffic conditions.
    
2. Data-Driven: Data-driven short-term traffic forecasting harnesses historical traffic data and real-time information. Machine learning and data analysis techniques are commonly employed to develop accurate forecasts based on this data.
    
3. Streaming Data-Driven: Streaming data-driven forecasting utilizes real-time data feeds and continuously updates predictions as new data becomes available. This approach allows for adaptive and dynamic responses to changing traffic conditions, making it highly suitable for real-time traffic management.
    

  

The need for short-term traffic forecasting is paramount for effective traffic management and control. It empowers authorities to take proactive measures to alleviate congestion, reduce travel times, and improve road safety.

  

The shift in traffic forecasting literature towards data-driven approaches is a reflection of the wealth of real-time data now available and the potential of machine learning and data analysis techniques to provide more accurate and adaptive forecasts. These data-driven methods offer the promise of improved real-time traffic management and more effective strategies for mitigating congestion.
