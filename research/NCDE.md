# Neural Controlled Differential Equations
NCDEs are considered a continuous analogue to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which can be written as follows:

$$ \begin{align*} \\
\large z(T) &= z(0) +  

\end{align*}$$
The theory of the controlled differential equation (CDE) had been developed to extend the stochastic differential equation and Ito calculus far beyond semimartingale setting of $X$
