## Historical Materialism (histomat)
Scientific Based understanding of historical events
Events are produced by a specific set of causes
just because those causes cannot yet be fully understood, does not mean they do not exist (in the material plane)

Historical Materialism provides us the idea that the resulting culture and way of life of a human society at any given point is based on its mode of production:
- the forces of production
	- instruments and natural resources
	- labour
- the social relations that exist in said force of production
	- relation of a person to the society's material interest
	- property and laws
	- social classes

how societies go about production ultimately determines the set of ideas, culture, social structures the way in which it governs itself, and so on. A change in the mode of production forces a change in the social phenomena in the society. The cause of social phenomena is material.

An increase of the quality of production of a society establishes (surplus product, which then establishes) specialized needs (and specialization) which results in a class society. 
Politics arises in class society demonstrated by class struggle, wherein conflicting classes have competing interests (E.G. Land and tools owned by a lord, Farmers do the work for the lord in exchange for a portion of the product produced)
- The state then emerges as a result of this class struggle as a body that attempts to resolve this conflict. 
- wielded by the ruling class whose basis of existence is to appropriate as much of the surplus product as possible.
as changes occur within society, new ruling classes may emerge (that will want to alter social relations and enforce its own social order) and existing ones may stagnate and decay (usually results in a revolution) a struggle for political supremacy ensues (the power to alter and enforce societies relations).

## Dialectical Materialism (diamat)
Diamat then asserts that change is the outcome of a *dialectic* between contradictory elements at every level of social revolution to alterations in the composition of matter itself (*???*). This process is governed by 3 laws
- **The law of unity and conflict of opposites**
	- all phenomena exist of mutually contradictory elements
	- change is the result of said phenomena's internal contradictions
- **the law of the transition of quantity into quality**
	- quantitative change leads to qualitative change
		- (quality is directly proportional to quantity)
		- the more surplus product overtime development of better quality is achieved
		- increasingly efficient workers continually develop an increasing amount of surplus product
		- ruling class reacts by out quality-ing the existing product
			- also by monopolizing the markets and innovative tech
- **the law of negation**
	- derived from Marx's *Capital*
	- capitalism is said to have come into being by negating or destroying feudalism
	- will in turn be negated by socialism and communism

*Ultimately*, 
diamat is a theory of scientific practices which transforms the ideological products of social practices into knowledges or scientific truths.
