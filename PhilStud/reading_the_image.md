Three kinds of images that describe our visual experience:
- Traditional Arts
- Print and TV media
- Contemporary Art

## Images in the Traditional Arts
- not all traditional arts bear images, but those that do are heavily linked with rituals
- they bear images in the form of symbols and motifs that convey narratives of communal / religious significance
- they function to preserve tradition and culture of the community from which the art was born
	- to understand their meaning, it is crucial to understand the religion/culture/tradition behind the art
- **Traditional** art is tied to religion and ritual. Its meaning is to be understood within the context of the tradition / culture / religion from which the art is made.

- The symbolism within traditional art are drawn from environmental (*natural world*) symbols like the sun, animals, etc., arranged in a meaningful manner

- the **T’boli**‘s belief that it pleases the gods to see humans embellish themselvs in beautiful human-made clothing 
  lead to the creation of the *t’nalakabaca* cloth dyed with the *ikat* method.
- In the **Cordilleras**, Ifugao blankets contain environmental symbols.
