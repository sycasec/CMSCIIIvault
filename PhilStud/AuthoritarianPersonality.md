# What is the Authoritarian Personality?
- written by Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson & Sanford (1950)
- right wing-extremism is used to explain the atrocities of the nazi regime
- the right wing extremism is a syndrome of authoritarian personality
## Psychodynamic (Freudian) theory of how authoritarianism is developed:
- harsh, punitive parenting with rigid values results in:
	- tension between anxiety from disapproval vs anger towards parents
- leads to “*intra-psychic*” conflict
- suppression of impulses leads to displacement of aggression to safer / weaker targets
- Anti-semitic attitudes co-vary with other characteristics
- Adorno et al. found positive association and formed the California F-scale based on interviews for attitudes, behaviors and histories


# California F Scale
measured 9 components
- **conventionalism**
	- rigid adherence to traditional, middle class norms and values
- **authoritarian submission**
	- submissive, uncritical attitude toward ingroup authorities
- **authoritarian aggression**
	- support for punishment of those who violate conventional norms
- **anti-intraception**
	- opposition to the subjective and the imaginative
- **superstition and stereotypy**
	- belief in mystical determinants of one’s fate
- **pre-occupation with power and toughness**
	- excessive concern with dominance/submission, strong/weak, leader/follower dimensions
- **destructiveness and cynicism**
	- general hostility towards humanity
- **projectivity**
	- outward projection of unconscious impulses leading to dangerous world beliefs
- **pre-occupation with sex**


problems with the f-scale
- acquiescence bias: 
	- no reverse keyed items
	- people will just agree with all the items
- studies that used reversed items had low reliability coefficients (they did not match up)

- other problems
	- only right-wing authoritarianism
	- no empirical evidence for Freudian/psychodynamic theoretical assumptions

-   Based on observation, which of the following trait enumerated in the F-scale does your relatives, friends, or close acquaintances register? (You may limit your example to one individual. Make sure that your example is someone who have a strong appeal to the likes of Marcos and Duterte).
-   (OPTIONAL) Do you feel at some point have exhibited any of those traits mentioned in the F-scale?
-   What extent that their traits have influenced political views? (remember that the personal is political vice versa)
-   Do you agree or disagree with the Adorno's theory?
