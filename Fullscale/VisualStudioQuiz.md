- While debugging an application, you notice that certain variables appear as grey in the watch window and you cannot see values. What is most likely the reason for this?
	- The variables do not relate to the current scope your breakpoint has been set to.
- You notice some of your files are hidden from the Solution Explorer view even though you know they are there when browsing them in File Explorer in Windows. What do you do to show the hidden files?
	- Click the `Show All Files` button at the top of the Solution Explorer panel.
- Your application has multiple company images inside it. You want the images to be included in your project's assembly, rather than being referenced with a URL. How can you build your solution so that your company images are included in the production assembly?
	- Use the `EmbeddedResource` build option for each company image.
- What would you do to logically separate multiple watch values?
	- Use the four available Watch windows.
- What does an object browser allow you to see?
	- All objects in a project along with their methods, properties, and events
- You have multiple classes, structs, and interfaces in the same file that you want to separate because it's difficult to find each of these types within the same file. How can you make this code more readable and easier to navigate?
	- Move a type to a matching file.
- You are in the middle of debugging your C# application and make code changes during the debugging session. Which scenario allows Visual Studio to apply the code changes on the fly as you are debugging it?
	- You have stopped the operation of the code at a breakpoint and then attempt to let the code operation continue.
- You want to analyze the value of a variable during a debugging session to investigate a bug. When you try to change the value of this variable when hitting a breakpoint, its value is not applied correctly. What is most likely the reason for this?
	- The **Edit and Continue** feature is turned off.
- When should you use exclude instead of unload from an existing .NET solution?
	- When an item must be disassociated from a workspace
- What is one downside to using the command `nuget add`?
	- only works with single packages
- Why should you run code coverage after updating your code?
	- Code coverage results are not automatically updated.
- During the writing of code, Intellisense prompts you with suggestions. Normally you press `Tab` **once** on an Intellisense to insert the suggested code adjustment Intellisense has prompted. You notice on this particular moment that `Tab` is not inserting the code as you expect. In what scenario would pressing `Tab` **once** not be enough to insert the Intellisense suggestion?
	- When the suggestion is a code snippet.
