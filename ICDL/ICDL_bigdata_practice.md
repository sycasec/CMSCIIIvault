		- glucose levels
	- mostly structured data
	- provides better medical service
- examples:
	- #### Artificial Intelligence in Medical Application
		- predictive analysis of patientâ€™s treatment
		- Clinical Decision Support (CDS) software used to analyze medical data 
		- help prescribe the right drugs and medical advice
	- #### Electronic Health Records
		- digitized medical records
		- facilitate applications of big data
		- patient information
			- demographic
			- medical history
			- allergies
			- lab test results
		- shared across secure info systems
		- can be accessed by any medical practitioner from any part of the world
		- US Kaiser Permanente uses EHRs through a secure comms network called HealthConnect
			- enables staff to review and exchange info quickly between offices
		- help in predictive analysis that assists doctors 
			- predict common diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure
	- #### Telemedicine
		- data analysis applied to large volume of patient data to create a virtual clinic
		- real-time consulting through video calls
		- effective for low and mild severity cases, those who need no physical examination
		- provide on-time medical advice in emergencies

## Big Data in Insurance
- subsectors of insurance are health, automobile, property and casualty, and life insurance
