# Model Adoption Factors
```toc
```

## Security
- major factor when using cloud services
- #### Security issues by cloud providers
- #### Security issues by customers

### Data loss and replication
- to avoid data loss, data is replicated (backup)
- backup may be susceptible to unauthorized access
	- data theft / identity hacking
- **STEPS TO MITIGATE**
	- avoid storing sensitive info on cloud
	- backup sensitive data internally
	- practice cloud encryption
### Insider attacks
- vendor employees / business employees (insider attack)
- **STEPS TO MITIGATE**
	- use encryption keys and passwords
	- conduct proper background checks
	- frequently monitor questionable activity
	- provide employee access only if necessary

## Privacy
- (some) vendors store multiple business data in one server
- business A data may be accessed by business B
- competitors may be on the same server
- **STEPS TO MITIGATE**
	- ensure all critical data is encrypted
	- give access to authorized users
	- protect digital identities and creds
	- securely store data about business

## Compliance
- laws and regulations on handling data
- **WHAT SHOULD BE DONE**
	- enable access control through multi-factor auth
	- know where data is stored
		- for security and compliance
	- ensure proper encryption
	- be aware of rules, regulations, and laws
### Maintaining a log and audit trail
- cloud vendors must ensure these are properly maintained
- must be accessible for forensic investigation
### Business continuity and data recovery plans
- make sure services will be maintained in case of failure or emergency
### Compliance
- recognize compliance standards

## Expertise
- lack of expertise because cloud is new tech
- **what should be done?**
	- understand existing culture in an organization and its attitude to new tech
	- investigate the required skills and processes to implement a cloud solution
	- analyze the existing skills and process gaps
	- understand what is needed to fill those gaps
- develop and execute a plan
	- provide apprenticeships, internships, and co-op opportunities
	- conduct regional collaboration with other organizations
	- conduct online education courses and programs
	- train or hire resources for immediate needs
	- provide sufficient time and opportunities to develop the knowledge 
## Costs
- pay-per-use, monitoring costs is important
- factors that decide cost:
	- lease period between vendor and business
	- resource cost
	- resource usage
	- service quality
	- maintenance
	- competition
## Management
### vendor lock-in
- cannot move to another service because of contract
- be aware of restrictions when selecting a vendor
- plan for transition between vendors
### SLA cloud service level agreement
- level of service to be maintained
- contract between business and vendor
### overspending
- carefully select appropriate solution
- actively monitor usage
## Questions to consider in choosing cloud model
### Is it your core business?
### do you have a wide range of products?
### are you a small or medium business?
### Are you Developing a New Service/Idea?
### Have you ever Faced an IT Revamp?
### Does your Company Handle Highly Sensitive Data?
### Which Cloud Payment Model will Fit your Organization?
