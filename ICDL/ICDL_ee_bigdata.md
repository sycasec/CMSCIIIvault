## what is big data?
- rapidly generated data (huge amounts)
	- structured
	- unstructured
	- semi-structured
- gaining popularity because of **big data analysis**
	- helps personalized recommendations
	- uses user data to produce insights (targeted ads)
	- boosts sales

### Structured Data
- data stored in orderly manner
- mostly found in databases
- data generated by:
	- machines
	- sensors
	- applications
	- servers

### Unstructured Data
- no clear format in storage
- content and web content generated by users
	- web sites
	- social media platforms

### Semi-structured Data
- no rigid form, cannot be stored in rows and columns
	- XML
	- zip files


## Key Stages in the Evolution of Big Data
### Phase 1: 1970 - 2000
- Primary components
	- **Database Management**
	- **Data warehousing**
- big data was stored within businesses, internally within the physical location
- data centers became accessible online through the internet
- The US Gov created the worldâ€™s first data center storing 
	- 175 M sets of fingerprints
	- 742 M tax returns
- in *1979*, IBM introduced the use of the **RDBMS**, primary foundation of big data

### Phase 2: 2000 - 2010
- Web-based unstructured content became the focus of data analysis for many organizations
- Growth of online stores, increased web traffic
- Amazon, Yahoo, and eBay used big data to analyze customer behavior
- unstructured and semi-structured data increased the demand for storage devices
- Facebook launched in 2004 and gained 5.5 M users by the end of 2005

### Phase 3: 2010 - Present
- Beyond mobile and sensor-based content
- smartphone now one of the most significant tools for collecting data
- businesses analyze the behavior of customers (targeted ads)
- Smartphone data collection includes
	- owner location
	- behavior
	- health - related data
- sensor based devices generate data
	- TV
	- refrigerator 

## Key Characteristics of Big Data

### Volume
- Total quantity of data
- Some sources for businesses are:
	- business transactions
	- outputs from industrial equipment
	- social media platforms
	- smart IoT devices
	- videos
- Platforms like Hadoop and Data Lake provide ample storage capacity at an affordable price
- These solutions allow a business to store their data in a system that can be easily integrated with analysis tools

### Velocity
- speed of data creation and collection
- organizations need processes / systems that can cope with millions of data daily
	- this allows them to derive insights without being overwhelmed
- Amazon Kinesis allows  organizations to analyse streaming data from video, website interactions, and IoT devices

### Variety
- breadth of sources of data analyze
- applicable also to processes within manufacturing and industry

### Variability
- Elimination of inconsistencies in data is necessary
- Unstructured data can have multiple variations

### Veracity
- quality / consistency / correctness of the data.
- necessity of data validation and data cleaning

### Value
- data is only important if it has value to an organization
- if it does not add value (improve business ops, etc.), it is not necessary.

## Trends Driving the Expansion of Data
- social media, web sites, cloud resources, IoT, and consumer relationship management systems
  are some of the sources of Big Data available for companies.

### Online Consumer and Organizational Activity
- In 2015, 2.07 B active social media users worldwide
- By 2020, 3.81 B
- Huge amount of data that is generated everyday on social media.
- business tools like **CRM** organize and make customer data accessible for analysis.
- Smart factories generate large amounts of data to provide automated solutions and maintain self-optimization.
- According to Fortune, global big data in manufacturing industry stood at USD 3.22 B in 2018, expected to reach 9.11 B in 2026

### IoT
- Huge amount of data generated by devices
	- smartphones
	- smart home hubs
	- smart manufacturing equipment
	- smart city systems / smart energy grids (?)
- major advantage is that data is transmitted in real time.
- Doctors can monitor patient health from remote locations using smart devices
- Bedridden patients can use devices to monitor glucose levels and anticipate health events
	- heart attacks based on previous medical records

## Increased Potential of Big Data for Organizations

### Flexibility and Scalability
- many organizations now have access to Big Data
- GBs can be stored / accessed at a much reduced cost.
- storage of all types of data [[#Structured Data]], [[#Semi-structured Data]], and [[#Unstructured Data]].

### Speed and Accuracy
- Big data streams feed into business processes at high [[#Velocity]], giving on-time and accurate insights.
- RFIDs combined with big data allows inventory tracking enhancement

### NLP
- can be used to process consumer and economic sentiments to predict market trends
- facilitates easier study of data in user reviews, employee evaluations, surveys, news, other txt sources.
- this ability to gather insights from massive text sources is a font of knowledge unfound before.
