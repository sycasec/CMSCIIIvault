# Arch setup

## TODOS
- Neovim
	- reconfigure LSPs
		- [typescript](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md)
			- look into typescript-language-server vs ts-standard
			- ts-standard seems to be an all in one (linter + everything)
			- reinstall colorschemes
			- reconfig keymaps

- Nvidia
	- install optimus
		- or set it permanently to nvidia
		- might be better to just install optimus since we have visual feedback that its currently on Nvidia mode
		- apparently optimus compat laptops should just install optimus
			- i dont make the rules

- install NVM
- install Rust analyzer
- install clang (??)
- install dotnet
- install miniconda or just conda

- bspwm soon
