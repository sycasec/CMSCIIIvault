| `intrusive`  | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.                                                                       |

## Tips and Tricks
- Essential to determine ports, apps, versions, as accurately as possible, as soon as possible
- perform a quick port scan first
	- `sudo nmap <ip> -p- -sV`
	- `-p-` all ports
	- `-sV` you know
	- `--stats-every=5s` exactly what it says
	- `-v/-vv` verbosity level â†’ shows open ports directly upon detection
	- `-T4` to max parallelization of port enum
		- automatically sets parallelization options
		- not sure what T5 does
