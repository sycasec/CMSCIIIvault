## Term - UI/UX Design

### Technical audience

User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design is composed of two different parts that complement each other. UI Design involves designing an application's graphical layout, which may include placement of buttons, screen layout, animations, transitions, color-scheme, and other stylistic choices.  

UI design is focused on the visual elements of the application, and a common format of UI design is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) design. GUI design deals with how users interact with visual elements and control panels of a computer-based system. An example of this is Windows' Desktop, Apple's Aqua, Linux-compatible GUIs such as KDE, GNOME, XFCE and many others. UI design can also be applied in voice-controlled interfaces (VUI) which involves designing user-system interaction using voice (Siri for iOS devices, Bixby for Samsung's Android devices). 

UX Design is focused on how to create a positive experience for the user while using the application. This can be accomplished through creating a logical and intuitive navigation system, establishing smooth and fluid usage of the application's components. 

The UX Design process involves Interaction Design in which ease of use is established, allowing the application users to accomplish their tasks effortlessly through the use of interactive components like page transitions, animations and other features that can make the user-experience fluid. Extensive user research is also performed to properly capture the feedback of potential users, allowing the UI/UX designers to present the application components in the most understandable way possible.


### Non-technical audience

User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design is two different application design approaches, both of which are geared towards designing the visual aspects of an application. While the end product requires input from both design methods, the process of designing the UI and the UX is very different.

UI is focused on how the product looks and feels when the user is interacting with an application. UI designers are concerned with the visual quality of the end product, making sure that the application design is pleasing to the user. UI Design can also be applied to voice-activated systems like Siri, where the priorirty of UI designers would be to make Siri sound comforting and natural.

UX Design is anchored in the user experience, where UX designers focus on the functionality of the application. This means that the design process is geared towards making the application easy enough for babies to understand and operate. UX designers analyse how users interact with the application and provide inputs to UI designers on how to make the application more intuitive and easy to use.
