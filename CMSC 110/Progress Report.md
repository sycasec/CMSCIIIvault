# Activity 3: Progress Report
***
### Introduction

The project being in its *inception* phase, the team pitched 3 project ideas to Ms. J Santillan, Mr. Fernand Bernardez, and Mr. Jason Nieva. The panelists curated and assisted the team to settle on the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system project over a route finding mobile application for Cebu jeepneys and group expense calculator and tracker. The proposed ERP system will be tailored towards the specifications of two of our team members' family businesses, ideally automating the workflow and internal activities. My role in the project is a frontend developer and I will be proposing a technology stack to create our frontend system and create a user interface (UI) / user experience (UX) design.

### Project Status 

Considering the necessities of producing an ERP UI/UX design and frontend, we would need an accessible design interface that we can easily present to the client to capture requirements. For this, we have deliberated with the team to use Figma as the primary UI/UX design tool, being an accessible, collaborative, online interface design tool. The team has also concluded on using ReactJS for frontend development, as React is a powerful library that offers interactive components and boasts ease of use. 

### Conclusion

With the project requirements incomplete, further communication with stakeholders will be undertaken to completely hash out expectations and clarify concerns. There also might be changes to the tech stack as we clarify requirements with the clients.
