              National and international meetings, such as the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) meetings, provide a central location for the gathering and dissemination of research. The purpose of this study was to determine the publication rates of both oral and poster presentations at CNS and AANS meetings in peer-reviewed journals.
            
            
              Methods
              The authors reviewed all accepted abstracts, presented as either oral or poster presentations, at the CNS and AANS meetings from 2003 to 2005. This information was then used to search PubMed to determine the rate of publication of the abstracts presented at the meetings. Abstracts were considered published if the data presented at the meeting was identical to that in the publication.
            
            
              Results
              
                The overall publication rate was 32.48\% (1243 of 3827 abstracts). On average, 41.28\% of oral presentations and 29.03\% of poster presentations were eventually published. Of those studies eventually published, 98.71\% were published within 5 years of presentation at the meeting. Published abstracts were published most frequently in the
                Journal of Neurosurgery
                and
                Neurosurgery
                .
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Approximately one-third of all presentations at the annual CNS and AANS meetings will be published in peer-reviewed, MEDLINE-indexed journals. These meetings are excellent forums for neurosurgical practitioners to be exposed to current research. Oral presentations have a significantly higher rate of eventual publication compared with poster presentations, reflecting their higher quality. The
                Journal of Neurosurgery
                and
                Neurosurgery
                have been the main outlets of neurosurgical research from these meetings.},

	abstract = {A technical note is a short article giving a brief description of a specific development, technique or procedure, or it may describe a modification of an existing technique, procedure or device applicable to medicine. The technique, procedure or device described should have practical value and should contribute to clinical diagnosis or management. It could also present a software tool, or an experimental or computational method. Technical notes are variously referred to as technical innovations or technical developments. The main criteria for publication will be the novelty of concepts involved, the validity of the technique and its potential for clinical applications.},
