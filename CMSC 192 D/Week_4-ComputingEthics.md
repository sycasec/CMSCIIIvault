## Principles, Laws, and Cases
#### What is Intellectual Property?
- tangible form of creative work
- may not be physical form
- intelligence and artistic work
	- value is derived from creativity
	- ideas
	- research
	- skill
	- labor
	- attributes
- protected by copyright and patent law

 #### U.S Copyright Law (Title 17 of U.S Code)
 - **gives copyright holder exclusive rights**
	 - to make copies
	 - produce derivative works
		 - translations
		 - movies based on books
	 - distribute copies
	 - perform the work in public 
	 - display the work in public

##### challenges of new tech
- digital tech and the internet make infringment easier
- new compression tech makes copying large files easier
- search engine makes finding stuff easier
- p2p, seeding, torrent, piracy arrrrrr
- broadband conn makes video on demand feasible
- mini cams enable to record plays and movies sneakily
- scanners change copyrighted media(physical) to electronic
- new tools allow us to edit stuff (adobe suite)
- *what exactly is the problem?*
	- for the customer, it is to get them cheaply
	- for writers, to ensure that they get the value for their product
	- for publishers, to protect their revenue
	- for scholars, to protect their hardwork (???)

**history of laws**
- **1790** first copyright law passed
- **1909** copyright act of (year) as aunauthorized copy as a form that coul be seen and read visually
- **1976 & 1980** revised to include software and databases with *authorship*
	- included *fair use doctrine*
- **1982** high-volume copying became felony
- **1992** multiple copies for commercial advantage became felony

**Fair Use Doctrine**
- four factors:
	- *purpose and nature of use* (commercial / non profit)
	- *nature of copyrighted work*
	- *amount & significance of portion used*
	- *effect of use on potential market or value of the copyright work*
- no single factor alone determines
- not all factors given equal weight, varies by circumstance

**ethical arguments about copying**
- c+v'ing a song or prgram does not decrease the use & enjoyment
- c+v'ing can decrease the revenue of owner
- () enables users to try out products, benefiting cp owner with sales
- business should make their own decisions about marketing products
- fair use guidelines are useful ethical guidelines
- many arguments for and against unauthorized copying

## Responses to CP Infringement
**ideas from software industry**
- software expiration date (adobe)
- dongles
- copy protection
- activation or reg codes (subl, windows, adobe, etc.)
- court orders to shut down internet bulletin boards (4chan?)

#### International Piracy
- some countries do not recognize intellectual property
- countries that have high piracy do not have SW industry
- these countries export to countries w/ strict CP laws
- economic sanctions are misfired on legit businesses

**banning, suing, and taxing**
- ban or delay tech via lawsuit
	- cd-recording devices
	- dvd players
	- portable mp3 players
- require that new tech include cp protections
- tax digital media to compensate the industry for expected losses

#### Digital Rights Management
- collection of techniques that control IP in digital formats
- HW and SW schemes using encryption
- file owner can specify what user can do
- Apple, Microsoft, Sony, use diff schemes of **DRM**

**digital millenium CP act (DMCA) 1998**
- anticircumvention
	- prohibit circumventing tech access controls
- safe harbor
	- protect websites  from lawsuits for copyright infringement by users

**DMCA vs Fair Use, Freedom of Speech, Innovation**
- lawsuits have been filed to ban new tech
- U.S Courts have banned techs like *DeCSS*(?) even though it is legit
- Protesters publish code as part of creative works
- DeCSS is a decryption program for encrypted DVD's, movies and stuff

**Safe Harbor**
- takedown notices as per DMCA
- so long as YouTube complies, they do not violate (hence, vid purge)
- notices may violate fair use
	- some have been issued against small portions of videos
	- issued against educational videos

**Evolving Business Models**
- orgs set up to collect and distribute fees
- itunes, napster, provide legal way to platform music
- content owners compensated
