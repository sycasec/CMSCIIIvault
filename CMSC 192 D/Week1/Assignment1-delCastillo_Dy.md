### 1. [[Kantian Ethics]] Approach

The idea of siphoning off small amounts of money from the programmer's coporation already appears to be morally wrong, according to Kant's Theory of Ethics where all actions must follow the `categorical imperative.`  

This is due to the fact that the Idea of Good Will states that:
- The act must be good by virtue of intrinsic value; and,
- The act is good without qualification or any condition.

The Formulation of the Categorical Imperative states that:
- The principle in which the an act is performed must be universalizeable.  

Siphoning off money from the advertising account of your company is immoral because it is *stealing*. Therefore, according to Kantian ethics, the programmer's idea is **morally wrong**.

A solution to this however, appears in plain sight:

It was made vague on what exactly are the terms in which the progammer performs these ideas. A simple solution that can be proposed is to take this up with his boss and lobby for a small partnership or charity project in his local town, that provides IT equipment and training to the people as well as making the project official and **without** the act of *stealing*.


### 2. [[Utilitarianism]] Approach

In utilitarian ethics, the *greatest benefit* for the *greatest good* is emphasized. However, the *greatest good* appears to be vague in this situation.
