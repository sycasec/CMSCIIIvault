### Jeremy Bentham's Model of Utilitarianism
- #### How does bentham view happiness?
	- it is simply ***the absence of pain***. 
	- wow! **Utility Calculus!**
		- intensity (the more intense damn boi horny af)
		- duration (the longer damnnnn my man famished)
		- certainty (the more certain damnnnnnnnnnn my man chill)
		- propinquity (the closer that it will occur damnnnn man slow down)
		- fecundity (the greater possibility that it will be followed by another on god)
		- purity  (the purity of the pleasure *wait was it meth all along*)
		- extent (the amount of people *yea my boi is getting high*)
	-  Happiness - pain = balance

### John Stuart Mill's Model of Utilitarianism
- Disagrees with my boi B, we cannot calculate that shit.
- #### the basis should be the majority of the people that attains happiness.
- **An act is morally right if it produces greatest happiness to the greatest number of people and it is morally wrong if it produces more pain than pleasure to the greatest amount of people.**
