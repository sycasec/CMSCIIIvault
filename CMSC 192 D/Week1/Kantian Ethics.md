### Core Concepts of Kantian Ethics
#### 1. The Idea of the **Good Will**
*What is it?*
	        Facilitates a human act;
	        Good by virtue of instrinsic value
	        Good without qualification or any condition

*How is it manifested?*
	        When done for the sake of duty

Examples
			When someone helps expecting something in return, the will is not good without qualification.
			
**Autonomy of the Will**
			Self-legislating 
			Not influenced by outside factors / forced

#### 2. Duty and the moral worth of an act
*What is it?*
			Duty should be the motive of any moral act
			Inclination or self-interest can never be the motive of any moral act
			Acts should be done not in accordance of, but for the sake of duty (to be moral).
			
#### 3. Formulations of the Categorical Imperative
**First Formulation**
		Act only on that maxim whereby you can, at the same time will, that it should be a universal law 
		If the maxim / principle on which the moral agent acts upon cannot be universalized, then the action involved has no moral worth

**Formula of the End**
		*Principle of Humanity*
		So act as to treat humanity whether in your own person or in that of another never as means but always as an end
