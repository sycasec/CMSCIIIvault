# Natural Law Ethics
### developed by St. Thomas Aquinas during the Medieval Period. (also called thomistic)

### Basic Idea
- #### Reason
	- the source of **moral law** that directs us towards **Good**.
- #### Good
	- the ultimate goal of the person's actions.
	- discoverable within the person's nature.
	- the basic goal is *to do good and avoid evil*.


#### Moral Good
- if it is done accordance to the **Moral Law**
- supposedly *reason* is the source, but then he says it comes from **God's Eternal Law.**
- He fumbled, and tries to save it by saying *the moral law is the Divine Law expressed in human nature* which says *do good and avoid evil*
- we know it follows those two if act is done according to conscience.
- ##### through the ***threefold natural inclination of the human person***:
	- **Self-preservation**
		- natural inclination to take care of self or not kill self
	- **Just dealing with others**
		- treat others with same respect we afford ourselves
	- **Propagation of human species**
		- all forms of birth control is evil
- ##### **Three determinants of moral actions**
	- **Object of the Human act**
		- that which the will intends primarily and directly
	- **Circumstance**
		- conditions affecting the morality of an action
			- Who
			- What
			- Where
			- By What Means
			- How
			- Why
			- When
	- **End**
		- Purpose of the doer
		  
		  
#### Four Principles of Double Effect
- intended action must be good in itself.
- good effect must follow the action at least as immediately as the evil effect
- foreseen evil effect should not be intended or approved
- there must be proportionate and sufficient reason to allow the evil effect to occur.
