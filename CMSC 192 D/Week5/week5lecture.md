#### Intentional, unauthorized access to computer systems
- the term (definition) has changed over time
- **Phase 1: The joy of programming**
	- early 1960 to 70
	- positive term
	- *hacker* was creative programmer who wrote clever or elegant code
	- *hack* was an especially clever piece of code 
- **Phase 2: 70's to mid 90's**
	- negative connotations
	- breaking into computers where hacker does not have authorized access
	- primarily individuals
	- spreading of computer worms / viruses, *telephone phreaking*
	- companies use hackers to analyze and improve security
- **Phase 3: growth of Web and mobile devices**
	- beginning mid 90's
	- viruses can now be spread rapidly
	- political hacking *hacktivism* on the rise
	- Denial-of-Service *DoS* attacks used to shutdown websites
	- large scale theft of personal and financial information

#### is "harmless hacking" harmless?
- responding to non-malicious or prank hacking uses resources
- hackers could accidentally do significant damage
- almost all of hacking is a form of trespass.

##### **Hacktivism, or Political Hacking**
- use of hacking to **promote a political cause**
- disagreement about whether it is a **form of civil disobedience** and how or should it be punished
	- arguments include:
		- some use the appearance of hacktivism to **hide other criminal activities**
		- how do you determine whether something is **hacktivism** or *simple vandalism*?

##### Hackers as security researchers
- **White hat hackers**
	- use their skills to demonstrate system vulns and improve security


##### Hacking as Foreign Policyh
- hacking by governments has increased (CIA, NSA)
- pentagon has announced it would consider and treat some cyber attacks as acts of war
	- us might respond with military force
- how can we make critical systems safe from attacks?

##### [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)
- *worm* uncovered in 2010
- targets *Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition* (**SCADA**) systems
- cause substantial damge to nuclear program of Iran
	- allegedly cyberweapon built jointly by the U.S and Israel in [Operation Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Olympic_Games)
	- specifically targets programmable logic controllers (PLCs) 
		- allows automation of processes which controls machines and industrial processes
			- including gas centrifuges for separating nuclear material
- exploited 4 zero day falws
	- worked by planting itself into siemens 7 os, overriding gas centrifuge control and making them go boom

##### Security
- **Hacking is a problem, but so is poor security** : factors that contribute
	- history of internet and the web
	- inherent complexity of computer systems
	- speed at which new applications develop
	- economic and business factors
	- human nature
- internet started with open access as a means of sharing info and streamlining research
- attitude towards security was slow to catch up with risks
- firewalls are now used to monitor and filter out communication from untrusted sites or that fit a profile of suspicious activity
- sec often plays catch-up to hackers as new vulns are discovered and exploited

# Identity theft and credit card fraud

#### Stealing identities 
- **various crimes in which criminals use the identity of an unknowing, innocent? person**
- examples include: 
	- use of credit/debit card numbers, info, security card numbers
	- 18-29 year olds are most common victims (*source?*)
	- e-commerce has made it easier to steal and use card numbers without having the phyiscal card
- **tehcniques used to steal personal and financial information**
	- requests for personal and fin info disguised as legitimate business communication
		- *Phisihing* - e-mail
		- *Smishing* - text messaging
		- *Vishing* - voice phishing
	- *Pharming* - false websites that fish info
	- Online resumes and job hunting sites may reveal SSN, work history, birth date and other info that can be used for identity theft
- **Responses to identity theft**
	- website / email authentication
		- prevents use of stolen numbers, might sacrifice convenience
	- encryption to securely store data, useless if stolen (?)
	- fraud alert flags in personal credit report.
		- some businesses cover the cost of credit report if your information has been stolen.
	- **Customer Authentication**
		- activation for new credit cards
		- retailers no longer print full card number and exp date on receipts
		- software detects unusual spending activities and prompt retailers to ask for info
		- third party services now allow customers to make purchases without revealing credit card information
	- **biometrics**
		- fingerprint, eyeprint
		- no cards, keys to be stolen
		- used in high security areas
		- can be spoofed but more difficult

### Crime : Whose laws rule the web
**When digital actions cross borders**
-  laws vary in diff countries
- corporations that operate in diff countries must comply with diff laws 
- this may cause legal actions to be illegal in another country 

**Yahoo and French Censorship**
- display and sale of Nazi memorabilia illegal in France and Germany
- Yahoo was sued in French court because French citizens could view Nazi memorabilia offered on Yahoo's U.S - based auction sites
- Legal issue is whether the french law should apply to Yahoo auction sites on Yahoo's computers located outside of france.
- yahoo argued that it wasn't technically feasible to block access from france

**Applying US copyright law to foreign companies**
- russian company sold computer program that circumvent controls in ebooks to prevent copyright infringement
- program legal in russia, illegal in U.S.
- Dmitry Sklyarov arrested on arrival in US, asked to present talk on weaknesses in control software used in ebooks
- was allowed to return to russia after protests in U.S. and other countries

**Arresting executives of online gambling and payment companies**
- executive of british online gambling site arrested as he transferred planes in Dallas (online sports betting legal in britain)
- *Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act* prohibits cc and online-payment companies from processing transactions between bettors and gambling sites.

**Libel, Speech and Commercial Law**
- even if something is illegal in both countries, the exact law and associated penalties may vary 
- in cases of libel, the burden of proof differs in countries
	- in the US, person suing has the burden of proof
- *libel tourism*
	- travelling to places with strict libel laws in order to sue
	- SPEECH act of 2010 makes foreign libel judgments unenforcable in the U.S if they violate the first amendment
	- foreign governments can still seize assets
	- where trial is held is important not just for differences in the law, but also the costs associated with travel between the countries
	- freedom of speech may suffer
- some countries have strict regulation on commercial speech and advertising

**Culture, Law, and Ethics**
- respecting cultural differences is not the same as respecting laws
- basically court of public opinion - whether or not laws should be passed according to this.

**Potential Solutions**
- *International Agreements*
	- Countries in World Trade Organization WTO agree to not prevent citizens from buying services from other countries if service legal in own
	- WTO agreement does not help when product, service, or info legal in one country and not the other  
- *Alternative principles*
	- **responsibiltiy to prevent access**
		- publishers must prevent material or services form being accessed in countries where they are illegal
	- **authority to prevent entry**
		- government of country blocks material entry if it is illegal
