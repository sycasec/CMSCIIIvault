[[Week 7]]
# Scenario 1: Protecting Personal Data
Your customer is a community clinic that works with families with problems of family violence.
It has three sites in the same city, including a shelter for battered women and children.
The director wants a computerized record and appointment system, networked for the three sites.
She wants a few laptop computers on which staffers can carry records when they visit clients at home and stay in touch with clients by email.
She asked about an app for staffers' smartphones by which they could access records at social service agencies.
At the shelter, staffers use only first names for clients, but the records contain last names and forwarding addresses (address when u live somewhere else) of women who have recently left.

## Brainstorming

### Stakeholders
- staffers
- clients:
	- women
	- children
- director - product owner

### Risks, Issues, Problems, Consequences
#### Obvious Risks
- **high-level access to records through a smartphone**
	- smartphone getting lost/stolen
	- someone unauthorized gaining access to said smartphone
- **Laptop computers with access to records**
	- would require security features/system when developed
	- might get hacked
		- security training against:
			- phishing
			- rubber duckies
			- protection and how to recognize unsafe networks
			- malware and RATs in general
- **Computer network across three sites**
	- requires a secure database
	- requires regular maintenance of database
	- loss of data access if internet is down
		- can be worked around
		- loss of access to data to other sites still possible


#### not so obvious risks

#### Issues

#### Problems

#### Consequences

### Benefits - for each
### Cases where there is no boolean decision

## Analysis
### Responsibilities of the decision maker
### Rights of stakeholders
### Impact of options on SH's (consequences, risks, benefits, harms, costs)
### categorize each potential action as ethically obligatory, prohibited, or acceptable.
### when there are multiple options, select one, considering the ethical merits of each, courtesy to others, practicality, self-interest, preference, etc.
