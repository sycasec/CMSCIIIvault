**main question**
- *can a student invoke the Data Privacy Act of 2012 if he/she refuses to give a copy of his/her hardbound thesis manuscript to the department as required? Justify.*
**discussion points**
- *what is RA 10173?*
- *what are some common elements of privacy policies you have read?*
- *what data does the university have about you?*
- *who has access to the data?*
- *how is your data protected?*


Republic Act 10173, also known as the "Data Privacy Act of 2012" was promulgated in 2012, it was drafted in 2016, but its implementing rules and regulations (IRR) took effect in 2017. It is a law that requires anyone processing personal information to secure and protect said data. Furthermore, it stipulates that the data subject, which is the person whose data is being processed, shall be informed that their information is being processed, how, and the purpose of the processing, assuming that the purpose is legal. 

This means that when companies request your consent, they have to allow the data subject to go through their privacy policy (which is a document that discloses the methods and purpose for which the data subjects' information is gathered, what information is gathered, etc.) and finally give their consent. This is commonly accomplished through a pop up bar or window in your browser containing a link to the company's privacy policy document followed by a checkbox, saying that you consent to your data being collected. Others accomplish this through the message "by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy". 

Albeit being found mostly online, this law is not limited to websites, and is applicable to any act data collection that any organization or individual may perform. This means that the organization or individual can be penalized by the law for malicious handling or usage of your data. This means that it can apply to your university, your organizations, etc. To be identify whether or not a student can invoke the Data Privacy Act to refuse submission of a copy of their hardbound thesis as required by the department, let us look at what data the university has about you, who has access to your data, and how it is protected.

The university has a copy of all your personal information - most universities require a valid ID, birth certificate, forms from your previous school, and all the other information you have supplied them on your registration form, which may include your ethnicity, religion, phone numbers, information on your relatives, household income, etc. Your hardbound thesis most likely only contains your full name, when the thesis was published and its publisher, and may or may not contain your contact information. Your hardbound thesis will most likely be kept for scientific purposes, to be stored in the universities library to give future researchers access to the information contained in your thesis that may assist them in their endeavors. To this end, it is important to note that the author's personal data their thesis is only stored for research purposes, wherein other researchers may be able to cite the author's works. The author's data contained within the hardbound manuscript is protected by the university as it only accessible to members of the institution who has access to where the manuscripts are stored.

So no, a student cannot invoke the Data Privacy Act of 2012, for reasons that under Section 4 (d), the act does not apply to personal information processed for journalistic, aritist, literary, or research purposes. Additionally under Section 19, The immediately preceding sections are not applicable if the personal information are used only for the needs of scientific and statistical research. Although I am not entirely sure if *immediately preceding sections* include Sections 1-18, i will simply assume it is so and that should be enough to conclude that there really are no grounds for which a student could refuse to submit their required hardbound thesis manuscript by invoking the Data Privacy Act of 2012.

However, it is important to note that I am not completely familiar with this law and most other policies concerned with personal data. The best option would be to speak to a lawyer, a privilege which I do not readily have but would certainly treasure (if given for free).
