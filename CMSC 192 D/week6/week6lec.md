## Privacy Risks and Principles

### Key aspects of Privacy
- freedom from intrusion (*being left alone*)
- control of information about oneself
- freedom from surveillance (*from being tracked, followed, watched*)

## Privacy threat categories
- intentional, uninstitutional uses of personal information
- unauthorized use or release of information by *insiders* or people who have access to your data
- theft of information
- inadvertent leakage of information
- our own actions
- **New technology, new risks**
	- government and private databases
	- sophisticated tools for surveillance and data analysis
	- vulnerability of data
	- **Search Query Data (search engines)**
		-  a lot of data can be collected and analyzed (terabytes daily)
		- data is mined to target advertising and develop new services
	- **Smartphones**
		- geo-location tracker apps
		- mobile banking data may be stolen secretly
	- **summary of risks**
		- anything we do in cyberspace is most likely logged or being recorded
		- huge amounts of data are collected daily
		- most people are not aware of data collection
		- software usually is complicated enough that users do not necessarily know or understand how it works under the hood
		- information leakage happens
		- collection of data about users can provide a detailed picture
		- re-identification (?) has become much easier due to the quantity of info from search and analysis tools
		- if info is in public website, it is available to everyone, and will most likely be available forever
		- data collected for one purpose will always find other uses
		- governments can request sensitive personal data held by businesses or orgs
		- we cannot directly protect the information we store online about ourselves.

### Terminology
- **Personal Information** - any info relating to user
- **Informed consent** - users being aware of what information is collected and how it is used
- **invisible information gathering** - collection of information about a user without the user's knowledge
- **cookies** - files website stores on the visitor's computer
- **secondary use** - use of PI for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided
- **data mining** - searching and analyzing heaps of data to find patterns and develop new information or knowledge
- **computer matching** - combining and comparing information from different databases (*e.g., using SSNs*) to match records.
- **computer profiling** - analyzing data to determine characteristics of people mostl ikely to engage in a certain behavior.
-  **Common Forms of Informed Consent**
	- **opt out** - user must request that an organization not use information
	- **opt in** - organization only collects information if user permits usage 

### Fair information Principles
1. inform people when you collect info
2. collect only the data needed
3. offer a way for people to opt out
4. keep data only as long as needed
5. maintain accuracy of data
6. protect security of data
7. develop policies for responding to law enforcement requests for data. 

## Business and Social Sectors
### Marketing and Personalization
- data mining
- targeted ads
- informed consent
- *Do Not Track* button in browsers
- paying for consumer information
- **Social Networks**
	- what we do
		- post opinions, pictures, location status
	- what they do
		- new services with unexpected privacy settings
- **Life in the cloud**
	-  security of online data
	- convenient
- **Location Tracking**
	- Global Positioning Systems (GPS) - know exactly where a person is at certain time
	- cell phones and other devices support this functionality
		- can be a tool to find missing persons or items
		- can be used by certain organizations to track your movement

## Government Systems
- **Databases**
	- Government Accountability Office (GAO) - monitors government's privacy policies
	- burden of proof and *fishing expeditions*
	- data mining and computer matching to "fight terrorism"
- **Public Records**
	- available to general public:
		- data on bankruptcy
		- property
		- arrest records
		- salaries of gov employees
	- identity theft can easily arise when public records are accessed and used for malicious purposes
	- how should we control access to sensitive public records?


## Protecting Privacy:

### Technology & Markets
- privacy enhancing-tech for consumers
- encryption
	- **public key cryptography**
- business tools and policies for protecting data

### Rights and Laws
- **look up local laws**
- **Free Market View**
	- freedom of consumers to make voluntary agreements
	- diversity of individual tastes and values
	- response of the market to consumer preferences
	- usefulness of contracts
	- flaws of regulatory solutions
- **Consumer Protection View**
	- use of personal information
	- costly and disruptive results of errors in databases
	- ease with which personal info leaks out
	- consumers need protection from their own lack of knowledge, judgment, or interest
- **EU regulations**
	- prohibits transfer of personal info to countries outside EU that do nothave an adequate system of privacy protection
	- *Safe Harbor* plan
	- abuses still occur
	- puts requirements on businesses outside EU
	- US does not have adequate data regulation

## Communications
### Wiretapping and Email Protection
- **telephone**
	- 1934 comms act prohibited interception of messages
	- 1968 omnibus crime control and safe streets act allowed wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law-enforcement (with court order)
- **email and other new comms**
	- electronic comms privacy act of 1986 (ECPA) extended the 1968 wiretapping laws to include electronic comms, restricts government access to emails
- **Comms assistance for law enforcement act (CALEA)******
	- 1994
	- requires telecomms equipment be designed to ensure that the gov can intercept phone calls (with court order or other authorization)
	- rules and reqs written by federal comms commission (FCC)
- **National Security Agency NSA**
	- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established oversight rules for the NSA
	- because NSA has secret access to communication records. they still do though.

## Data Privacy Act Philippines
- law that requires anyone processing personal information to protect said data
- data privacy act of 2012, republic act 10173
	- promulgated in 2012, 
	- implementing rules and regulations took effect in 2017 
	- drafted in 2016
	- since 2017, influx of registrations of data protection officers with the national privacy commission

### What is covered by the law?
- balances freeflow of info and the protection of the personal info of data subjects
- **three principles governing the processing of personal data**
	- *transparency* - requires notices to be given to the data subjects
		- data subject right to be informed that their data is being processed, 
		- what type of processing is being done, 
		- what is the purpose of this processing
	-  *personal data* - any type of information wherein the identity of the individual can be reasonably determined
		- *regular personal information*
			- name
			- address
			- tel number
		- *sensitive personal information*
			- race
			- ethnic origin
			- marital status
			- date of birth
			- health and educational info
			- government identifiers
				- tax identification number (TIN)
				- sss id
				- current health records
				- licenses
			- any info considered classified by law

### How does this affect businesses?
- **four main requirements**
	- registration of the data protection officer, provided that it breaches the mandatory threshold
	- lawful processing of personal data
		- collection should be legitimate
		- processing should be lawful
		- retained only as long as necessary, must be discarded after.
	- lawful shareing / disclosure of personal data
		- in event of breach, there must be due notification for National Privacy Commission and due data subjects within 72 hours
	- where is the fourth one :sob:


### what has changed with the implementation of the law?
- consent requirement, opt-in jurisdiction
	- NPC regulates this with privacy sweep of applications (why tf do we have shopee on our asses tho)


### Crime and punishment
- unauthorized / malicious disclosure
- fine or imprisonment
- penalty is ranging from 500k to 1m php (??? gamaya)
