## Summary
During the last five years, First National Bank (FNB) has been one of the fastestgrowing banks in the Midwest. The holding company of the bank has been actively
involved in purchasing small banks thoughout the state of Ohio. This expansion
and the resulting increase of operations had been attended by considerable growth
in numbers of employees and in the complexity of the organizational structure. In
five years the staff of the bank has increased by 35 percent, and total assets have
grown by 70 percent. FNB management is eagerly looking forward to a change in
the Ohio banking laws that will allow statewide branch banking.
