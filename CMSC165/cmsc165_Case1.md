# Case 1
## Questions
### Why did Global Green Books Publishing Struggle?
- Global Green Books did not prepare for the scale of the demand of their third major customer, as they were unable to do their due diligence upon working on a considerably larger project - based on the critical problems listed. The company overestimated production capability and it has terribly backfired on them. Their new Project Manager Samantha also notes that the company lacked a disciplined approach to project planning.
### What were the specific PM solutions that were introduced by Samantha that worked?
- Samantha introduced formal project management processes
- initiated a Project Management manual
- trained employees based on the new Project Management manual
- Proactive Risk Analysis
- Risk Response Planning
- Improved communication with stakeholders
### What kind of suggestions would you give to Brad and Jim if you were the PM?
- **Establish a Project Management Department** - since the company operates on a project to project basis, a Strong Matrix organizational chart with a Manager of Project Managers, along with several Project Managers, allows the company to scale client-wise. 
- **Utilize Project Management and Contact Resource Management tools** - oversight and control over projects will be streamlined if a project management tool is used such as a kanban board or a deadline tracker. A CRM tool can also be useful to monitor client activity and simplify resource selection.
- **Conduct Project Reviews** - Regular project reviews allows the company to assess performance internally and establish best practices for future projects.
- **Establish Finance and Legal Department** - since the company wants to scale, Finance and Legal will be crucial in managing corporate finances and streamlining legal requirements and policies of the company.
- **Initiate Documentation** - As the company grows, the amount of employees will increase. Creating a documentation or manual of company processes will speed up employee onboarding.
### Are you aware of other similar start-up businesses that struggle in a similar manner? How did they overcome the challenges?
- Many start-up businesses like this cannot scale due to being unable to beat established, multi-million or multi-billion dollar markets. They are often acquired or sell out, or go bankrupt. This is because the established markets already dominate the scene and already have streamlined processes as well as dedicated contacts for resources. Silicon Valley startups work in a similar manner, where the company gathers investors for capital in exchange of stock shares. Rarely does a startup like Global Green Books break the market and become an established company without being acquired by a larger corporation.
### Global Green Books Publishing is a technology intensive business, but Samantha is not technically knowledgeable, will she continue to be a successful project manager?

- Yes, since Project Management is an entire skillset meant to improve the companyâ€™s project delivery and resource management regardless of technology used. The practices and skillsets of an adept Project Manager should be applicable to any company as it is a framework meant to support and improve existing processes.
