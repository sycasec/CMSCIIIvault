### CSMC 124 - Design and Implementation of Programming Languages
# Learning Log

## I used to think that
There is not much to say here. Most topics are discussed under CMSC 21 where we deep dived into C and C++, aside from prefix and postfix notations.

## Now I know that
Postfix and prefix notations. I did not know about these **at all**. They are pretty good at diminishing ambiguity in a mathematical expression.

## The part I know most about is
Type casting, type conversion, overloading, precedence and association rules. These are topics that I have faced time and time again when coding stuff.

## The part that was newest to me was
Postfix and prefix notation. My first thought when I read it up was that it was some kind of way a compiler or interpreter would display nodes visited when parsing, or when displaying a parse tree or something. Surprising to know that it is actually a less ambiguous way to write an expression. It all makes sense now.

## The part that was most confusing is
There has not been any part that was confusing, as most of these topics have already been discussed heavily in previous CMSC courses. The postfix and prefix notations for expressions are not confusing at all. If anything, they are less confusing than their infix counterparts. It is also relatively easy to translate them into infix notation mentally, but I am yet to try it out with code.

## I'd like to know more about 
I'd like to know more about how each of these features are implemented in some languages, specifically how and why they are different.
