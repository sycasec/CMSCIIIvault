# Type Conversion
```toc
```

process of converting a variable from one datatype to another
datatypes are organized in a heirarchy based on the size of type / how much data a type can represent

## Narrowing Conversion
- converting expression to data type that cannot represent all values of original type
- new type has less storage
- unsafe
	- int to bool

## Widening Conversion
- expression to DT that can represent all values of original type
- new type greater storage
- safe
- int to long long int
