### CSMC 124 - Design and Implementation of Programming Languages
# Learning Log
---
## I used to think that
There is no formal name for asynchronous or synchronous functions, or functions that run on different threads. I used to think that threading is a recent development in programming.

## Now I know that
They are formally called concurrent statements or maybe even concurrent functions, and this concept has been founded a long time ago.

## The part I know most about is
Most topics presented in Assignment, because I am confident I can implement these features if I try to make my own programming language / compiler.

## The part that was newest to me was
None really, I have already encountered these concepts before in previous CMSC courses. It is a good refresher. Most of these topics were not as heavily discussed but I have made my own progress in learning these topics independent of coursework.

## The part that was most confusing is
There has not been any confusing part so far, the presentations are well made and straightforward in delivering information. 

## I'd like to know more about 
How iterations and concurrent processes are implemented in a compiler or programming language, right now it seems to be difficult for me and I am eager to learn how these processes are performed on a low level.
