### CSMC 124 - Design and Implementation of Programming Languages
# Learning Log
---
## I used to think that & Now I know that 
There is not much that I can say about this, because most of these topics were already discussed in the same or more complexity in previous CMSC courses, allowing me the advantage of prior knowledge which makes the intake of the information presented in the lecture slides more efficient and overall faster.

## The part I know most about is
Variables, because variable storage, access, manipulation, scope, binding, and its implementation in the computer hardware and software was discussed heavily in the course CMSC 133, where we learned how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated, as well as basic implementations in Assembly Language

## The part that was newest to me was
The fact that in most languages that often used today, there is no limit to the variable name length.

## The part that was most confusing is
There has not been any part that was confusing, as most of these topics have already been discussed heavily in previous CMSC courses. In my personal experience, I have once went through the trouble of confusion and now can confidently say that I have achieved full understanding of most topics discussed in the lecture slides.

## I'd like to know more about 
How these would be implemented in a language parser/compiler, and how automated tools that generate language parsers implement these functionalities.
