**Variables are characterized b attributes**
- to deisgn a type, one must consider the scope, lifetime, type checking, initialization, and type compat

## Names
- **Design issues:**
	- are names case sensitive?
	- are special kwords reserved words or keywords?
- **Length**
	- if too short, cannot be connotative
	- examples:
		- **c99**: no limit, only first 63 are significant
		- **c#, Java**: no limit, all sig
		- **C++**: no limit, implementers often impose (naming convention)
