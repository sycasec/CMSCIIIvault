Lesson/Topic: Procedure and Subprograms
### CSMC 124 - Design and Implementation of Programming Languages
# Learning Log
---
## I used to think that
Function implementation is relatively simple, since I have been able to implement subroutines in Assembly.

## Now I know that
Function implementation in a compiler or trans-piler is complicated, what more with higher order and asynchronous functions. Keeping track of variable changes might prove to be a challenge.

## The part I know most about is
I have already encountered topics like the basics of subprograms and their design issues, Exception handlers, parameter passing methods, overloaded and generic subprograms, and finally user-defined overloaded operators with CMSC 21 and CMSC 23.

## The part that was newest to me was
There isn't really any topic that I have not encountered in previous CMSC courses, but the presentations provide a good, in-depth refresher. Some presentations also provided little bits of knowledge that I have not encountered before, such as the formal definition and difference of a subprogram and a subroutine. Otherwise, most of the topics have already been heavily discussed in previous courses I have taken.

## The part that was most confusing is
There has not been any confusing part so far, the presentations are well made and straightforward in delivering information. 

## I'd like to know more about
Currently I am not sure what I want to know more about, I find learning low-level implementations very intimidating, so much with learning more assembly. However someday I would like to be able to learn more about computer architecture and computer systems architecture enough that I can be confident in my skills and knowledge of low-level computing.
