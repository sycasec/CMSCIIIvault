# Data Communication Basics and Definitions
## Data Communication 
- active process of transporting data from one point to another
- exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wired cable
## Basic Components
- ### message
	- information (data) to be communicated
	- text, numbers, pictures, audio/video, combination of all
- ### Sender
	- aka *Transmitter*
	- sends the data message
	- computer, workstation, telephone, phone, video camera, etc
- ### Receiver
	- receives message
- ### Medium
	- physical path in which message travels from sender to receiver
	- examples 
		- twisted-pair wire
		- coaxial cable
		- fiber optic cable
		- laser / radio waves
			- satellite
			- terrestrial
- ### Protocol
	- set of rules that describe data communication
	- ![[Pasted image 20230827212953.png|300]]

## Characteristics of Effective Data Comm
- ### Delivery
	- data must arrive at correct destination
	- only received by intended user or device
- ### Accuracy
	- data may be altered when received.
- ### Timeliness
- ### Jitter
	- variation in packet arrival time
	- when streaming a video, sudden quality changes may appear 

## Data Flow (traffic)
- ### Simplex
	- one-way communication (sender → receiver)
	- keyboard, monitor etc
- ### Half-duplex
	- each station can transmit and receive but not both at the same time
	- can only take one of two states ( receive || transmit ) 
	- walkie talkie
- ### Full-duplex
	- simultaneous
	- phone call
	- telephone line

## Communication Media
- ### Wired
	- #### wire pairs
		- used in local telephone communications
		- short distance digital data comm
		- copper
		- normally 9600 bits-per-second at a distance of 100 meters
	- #### twisted pair 
		- common medium for telecomm
		- copper wires twisted into pairs
			- ordinary telephone wires consist of two insulated copper wires twisted into pairs
		- computer networking cabling (wired Ethernet IEEE 802.3)
			- 4 pairs of copper cabling
			- voice and data transmission
		- 2 million to 10 billion bits-per-second 
		- unshielded twisted pair (UTP)
		- shielded twisted pair (STP)
		- twisted to reduce noise generated by **electromagnetic interference** (EMI) from other sources
	- #### coaxial cable
		- used for: 
			- cable television systems
			- office buildings
			- local area networks
		- copper or aluminum wire
			- wrapped in insulating layer of flexible material with high dielectric constant
			- finally surrounded by conductive layer
			- help minimize interference and distortion
		- transmission from 200 m to > 500m bits per second
	- #### optical fiber
		- one or more filaments of glass fiber wrapped in protective layers
		- carries data by pulses of light
		- not affected by EM radiation
		- transmission at trillions of bits-per-second
			- can be increased by use of colored light
			- use of multiple wavelengths to carry multiple messages
- ### Wireless
	- #### Terrestrial microwave
		- earth based transmitter and receiver
		- equipment similar to sat dishes
		- low GHz range, limits comms to line of sight
		- relay stations are 48km apart
		- microwave antennas placed on top of buildings, towers, hills, and mountain peaks
		- ![[Pasted image 20230827220523.png|400]]
	- #### comm sat
		- microwave radio signals as telecomms medium
			- not deflected by earf atmosphere
		- stationed in space
			- 35,400 km for geosynchronous satellites above equator
		- capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, TV signals
		- ![[Pasted image 20230827220656.png|500]]

## Bandwidth
- data handling capacity of comms service
- measure of how much info (bits) can flow from one place to another
	- per second, etc
- data transfer rate is measured in *baud* (similar to bits-per-second)
- rate of 300 *baud* is 300 bps
- three classes
	- ### Narrowband
		- aka voiceband
		- low data volumes
		- < 100 kbps 
		- regular telephone comms
	- ### Medium-band
		- moderate data transmissions
		- 100kb < x < 1 megabit / second
		- long distance data transmission
	- ### Broadband
		- large volumes of data
		- 1 million baud or more
		- high-speed data analysis and sat comm

## Modem
- ### Landline
	- connect to public switched telephone network  (PSTN)
	- modems have a jack known as RJ-11 (regular phone jack)
- ### Wireless
	- radio transmitters/receivers installed into mobile computing devices
	- WiFi?
- ### LAN 
	- shared remote access to LAN resources
- Modern modems contain all 3 types of modems

## Computer Network
- interconnection of various computer networks
- linked together with a medium and data communication devices for sharing resources
- computer that provides resources known as server
- in a network, individual computers are known as nodes
## Concept of Networking
- collection of hardware components and computers interconnected by comm channels
- maybe classified according to:
	- medium of transmission
	- comms protocol
	- scale
	- topology
	- organization scope
- rules and data formats for exchanging information in a network are described and defined by the protocol
## Properties
- facilitate comms
- permit sharing of file, data, and other types of info
- `optional:`  share network and computing resources
## Benefits 
- file sharing
- peripherals sharing
- internet connection sharing
- multi-player games
- internet telephone service (VoIP)
- Home entertainment

## Network Criteria
- ### Performance
	- #### transit time
		- time required for message to travel from one device to another
	- #### response time
		- elapsed between inquiry and response
	- #### factors affecting performance:
		- number of users
		- transmission medium
		- hardware capabilities
		- software efficiency
	- #### network metrics to evaluate performance
		- throughput 
			- data transmitted over time
		- delay
			- how long it takes for data to travel from one node to another
- ### Reliability
	- measured by:
		- accuracy of delivery
		- frequency of failure
		- time it takes a link to recover from a failujre
		- network’s robustness
- ### Security
	- protecting data from unauth access
	- protecting data from damage
	- implementing policies and procedures to recover from breach / dataloss
## Physical Structures of Network
### Types of Connection
- #### point to point
	- dedicated link between two devices
	- entire capacity of link is dedicated for transmission between those two devices
	- use an actual length of wire or cable to connect two ends
- #### multipoint
	- more than 2 devices share a single link
	- capacity of channel is shared spatially or temporally
	- spatial
		- several devices can use the link simultaneously
	- temporal (time shared)
		- users take turns
### Types of Network
- #### LAN
	- privately owned
	- links devices in a single office , building, or campus
	- can be as simple as 2 PCs and a printer
	- size is limited to a few kms
	- speed is normally 100 < x < 1000 Mbps
	- Wirless lan (wLAN) is latest evolution in lan tech
- #### WAN
	- long distance transmission over large geographical areas
	- country, continent, or whole world
	- complex as the backbones that connect the internet
	- or dial up line that connects home computer to the internet
- #### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
	- size LAN < MAN < WAN
	- covers the area inside a town or city
	- designed for customers who need high speed connection to internet
- today it is very rare to see a lan, man or wan in isolation

- Open Systems Interconnection Model
- in 1957 by ISO
- layered model that dominated data comms and networking literature before 1990
- replaced by TCP/IP
