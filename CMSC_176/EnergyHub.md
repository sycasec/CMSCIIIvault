# Energy hub: modeling, control, and optimization

## Short Background
- Energy hub integrates different forms of energies (Renewable) and their conversion from one form to another
- storage and consumption carried out in one place
### Energy Management Systems
- a plant contains several systems such as 
	- heating, boiler, power,
	- furnaces, power supply, temperature control
	- refrigeration, illumination, ventilation,
	- steam, motor, instrumentation, AC, auxiliary systems
- all data is recorded for future planning (Big Data Analysis)
### Energy hub
- multicarrier energy infrastructure, combines different types of DERs
- main components are:
	- Combined heat and power 
	- Boiler
	- Transformer
	- Electric Chiller
	- Absorption Chiller
	- ES
	- CS
	- HS
- main disadvantage of conventional energy grid is the focus on electrical energy
	- energy hub includes RERs
	- answers to multiple demands (heating, electrical, cooling)
	-
