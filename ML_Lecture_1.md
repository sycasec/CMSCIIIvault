## Overview
- a *statistic* is any value calculated from a given sample
- in statistical inference, we make a decision using the information provided by a sample
- most of machine learning is parameter estimation

## Parametric Learning
- parametric
- assume that the sample is drawn from some distribution that obeys a known model
- model is defined up to a small number of parameters
- linear regression
- dependent on a set assumption of prior distribution
	- normal distribution
	- skewed
	- etc
- we can approximate the shape of the distribution
- non parametric = more parameters :O
- once the parameters are estimated form the sample, the distribution is known
- we estimate parameters of the distribution from the given sample
	- plug in estimates to assumed model

## Possibility Distributions
- List of all possbile outcomes of a random variable is called *probability distribution*
- 2 two types
	- **Discrete**
	- **Continuous Probability**

### Discerete
- description of the probability of occurence of eacch value of discerete random values
