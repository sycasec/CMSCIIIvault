# Modelling 
- given everything collected during communication, dev team analyzes and presents these data that will lead to design of the software

## Requirements Modelling
- uses a *combination* of text and *diagram* stuff to depict reqs
	- *easy to understand*
	- straightforward to review for:
		- **correctness**
		- **completeness**
		- **consistency**
- business analyst / sw eng analyses data from collected info from user to identify what they really need 
	- the result is the specs of the software.
	- in this phase we can now somewhat identify the scope of the project
	- *Ms Ai input*
		- review other implementations of your software
		- identify the satisfaction rating from users of said software
		- use other implementations as basis of your software
- tools are used to create a system description as well as a design model 
	- this can be used to give the dev team a clear view of what is trying to be created
	- gives target client a compact model of product 

### Requirements Model 3 primary objectives
- **describe what the customer requires**
- **establish basis for creation of software design**
- **define set of requirements that can be validated once the software is built**

## Approaches to Requirements Modelling
- main goal is to suggest a combination of representations that will:
	- provide the **best model of software requirements**
	- **most effective bridge to software design**

- dependent on 
	- tech resources available
	- process model we will follow
- for XP, object oriented programming is recommended

### Scenario-based models
- depicts how user interacts with the system
- specific sequence of activities that occur as software is used
- tools:
	- use cases
	- user stories


### Class-based elements models
- objects that the system will manipulate
- operations applied to objects
- collaborations that occur between classes defined
- tools
	- class diagrams
	- colalboration diagrams


### Behavioral models
- depict how exeternal events change the state of the system
- behavior of objects within the system
- tools
	- state diagrams
	- sequence diagrams

### Flow models
- system as an information transform
- depicts how data objects are transformed as they flow through system functions
- tools
	- Data flow diagrams
	- data models
