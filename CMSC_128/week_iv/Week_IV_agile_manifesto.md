# Agile Manifesto
- by Alistair *cock* **burn**

- **individuals and interactions** over process and tools
- **wokring software** over comprehensive documentations
- **customer collab** over contract negotiation
- **responding to change** over following a plan

#### How to manage unpredictability?
- software process must **adapt incrementally**
- increments must be delivered in a short amount of time
- deliver smaller executable prototypes or portions of operational system
- adaptation must keep pace with change / unpredictability

#### Diff?
- **actions, tasks, methods, tools, philosophies.**
