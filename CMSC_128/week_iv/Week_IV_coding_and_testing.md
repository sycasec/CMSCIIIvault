## Coding and Testing

#### Test Driven
- **unit tests**
	- created before coding
		- this allows devs to focus on what exactly needs to be implemented
		- errors are potentially reduced
	- code implemented based on unit tests
- **pair programming**
	- two heads are better than one
	- real time code review
	- code is reviewed while being constructed
	- more people understand the codebase rather than one person
	- faster development due to real time QA
	- **mob programming**
		- each person in a team takes turns to be the *driver*
		- others are the navigator
		- works best in 3-4 people teams
- **integration teams**
	- code immediately integrated with the work of others
- **TESTING ACTIVITIES**
	- **automated tests**
		- test done everyday
		- suite of tests are ran
	- **integration & validation**
		- faster with automated tests
		- new code can be smoke-tested each time
	- **acceptance tests**
		- focus on overall system fucntionality
		- feedback from customers
