# Planning Activities
- collection of user requirements, estimation of schedules combined

### Planning Game
- participated by both *customers* and *devs*
- customers write reqs as *user stories*
	- description of software requirements
	- expected output, why it is needed
	- **customers** assign *priority value* to each user story
		- to see what customers want
		- see which ones are common
		- identify which functionalities need to be done first
- **Methods** : discussed in [[Week_IV_scrum|scrum]]
	- Moscow
	- 100 point method
- **developers** assign a *cost* measured in development weeks
	- if story cost > 3 weeks:
		- story split into smaller stories
		- repeat.
- what if there is **change?**
	- change is a new user story
	- accomodated in the next increment
	- depending on the priority
- **Release Planning**
	- *customers* and *devs* discuss how to **group** stories
	- stories are listed according to priority
	- identify which stories should be seen in the first, or in next increments
- **Iteration Planning**
	- devs break down stories into task
	- estimate their cost in deeper detail
	- based on previous iteration, team commits on what should be made in current iteration
	- repeat
