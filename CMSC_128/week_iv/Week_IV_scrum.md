## Introduction to Scrum
### What is Scrum?
- **Scrum is  Framework for dealing with complex work**
- alternative to practices more suited to manufacturing / construction

**20th Century Practices**
- work focused on execution rather than innovation
- everything was more predictable work
- **today**, predictable work is done very quickly by machines

- **SCRUM**
	- framework for learning about work
	- and the processes we use to do work
	- attempt to put chaos in a box
	- develop software products
	- **encourages feedback loops**
	- incremental release instead of one big release at the end

##### More on Scrum
- linear process flow is **risky** and **invites failure**
- The linear process flow is divided into **sprints**
	- analysis
	- design
	- implementation
	- testing
	- deployment
- team tries to build a deployable product increment (small)
- customers need to see the wrong product to specify what they need
- **sprints** are officially **30 days long**
	- some do this in 2 weeks
	- consists of self-organizing team
		- can start testing in first sprint
		- a bit of design every sprint (continuous design)
		- small amounts of refactoring
	- scrum team should collaborate together
		- you are not doing scrum if it is not **difficult** (sounds like slavery)
		- **fixing** your weaknesses is more important than *doing scrum*

### Scrum Elements

##### Roles
- **Product Owner**
	- Responsible for ROI
		- exerts influence to prioritization of product backlog
	- Final arbiter of requirements questions
		- final call on detail
		- vision on product dev
		- makes business decisions for the team
	- Focused more on the *what* rather than *how*
- **Scrum Dev Team**
	- cross-functional group
	- builds a "potentially shippable product increment" every sprint
	- collaborates
	- self-organizing
	- no heirarchy
	- 4-9 people
	- need a team room for collab??? ( for pair programming )
- **Scrum Master**
	- no management authority
	- doesnt have a pm role
	- actually useless lmaoooooo the role of the middle manager

##### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**
	- customer centric features
	- force ranked list
		- only one item at the top
	- prioritized by the product owner
- **Sprint Backlog**
	- what we need to do right now
	- commited backlog items
		- what we need to do right now
	- sprint tasks
		- how we do those backlog items
##### Meetings (Overview)
- **Sprint Planning meeting**
	- team and product owner negotiate which items added to sprint
	- team moves top priority into the sprint backlog
	- break into tasks
	- decides on the kind of work and if they're clear
- **Daily Scrum meeting**
	- daily standup meeting
	- report to the other team members
		- what member did yesterday
		- what member will do today
		- what are blockers
- **Sprint Review meeting**
	- demonstrate potentially shippable product increment
	- PO determines which are good and not
- **sprint retrospective meeting**
	- talk about what went well
	- what could be improved
	- give feedback to each other
- *backlog refinement meeting* no official name
	- po and team meet
	- refine details on future backlogs
	- break big backlog into smaller backlogs

## Backlog Refinement Meeting
- confined to a timebox, usually 2 hours
- a few workdays before the sprint planning meeting
- PO, dev team, Scrum Master (??) attends
- **purpose**
	- estimation of effort
	- clarification of requirements
	- decomposition of large PBI's
- create PBI (product backlog items) that are:
	- independent
	- negotiable
	- valuable
	- estimable
	- small 
	- testable
- starts with PO identifying priorities
	- PO and team breaks down top priority backlogs
	- identify the who, what, and the why when making user stories
- no priority commitment, this is done in sprint planning
## Sprint Planning Meeting
- four hour timebox to plan a 2 week sprint
- team and PO finalize wich PBI commited as Sprint Backlog
- team creates an initial lisk of tasks to complete PBI's
- focus on a small amount of PBI's first
- a SBI is *done* when
	- it is properly tested
	- refactored
	- potentially shippable
- Limit Work in Progress

## Daily Scrum Meeting
- what did i do yesterday
- what will i do today
- what impedes me
- 15 minutes

## Sprint Review Meeting
- team demonstrates potentially shippable increment
- product owner declares what features are done
- (optional) measure velocity 

## Sprint Retrospective Meeting
##### Safety Check
- allow the team to assess the working environment
	- scrum master facilitates but does not interfere

##### Focused Conversation Principles
- keep the group on the same step
	- Objective Questions (what happened?)
	- Reflective Questions (how do we feel about it?)
	- Interpretive Questions (what does it mean?)
	- Decision Questions (what are we going to do about it?)
- make sure decisions come last
##### Basic Retrospective
##### Silent Writing
- write down observations in notes
- people talk about them after
##### Timeline Retrospective
- team discusses the entire timeline of the sprint
##### Decisions
-
