### What is Agile?
- combines *philosophy* and a *set of development guidelines*
- for this to work:
	- the process allows team to adapt to tasks and streamline them
	- planning must be fast as well
	- limit production to essential products (features needed change)
	- incremental delivery, deliver asap
- the *philosophy* encourages:
	- customer satisfacction and early incremental delivery
	- small, highly motivated project teams
	- minimal work products
	- simplcity
- **delivery** over analysis and designs
- **active** and continuous communication between devs and customers

#### Cost of Software change
- in traditional software dev processes, software changes are more costly
- agile processes deliver basic functionalities early
- more complex changes are delivered and considered later
- **Triple Constraints**
	- *Time*
	- *Scope*
	- *Cost*
	- balance amongst these constraints
	- if change is introduced, the *scope* of project is increased
	- this means that the *time* taken is increased
	- consequently, *cost* is increased
