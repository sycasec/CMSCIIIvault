# Design Activities

### Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)

- encouraged use of **CRC (Class-Responsibility Collaborator) cards**
	- only document produced during design, aside from user story
	- used for modelling tools in object-oriented context
- **spike solutions**
	- used when design is challenging
	- **operational design prototype** 
	- implemented and evaluated to lower risk when true implementation 
	- similar to prototyping
	- classes and methods can be easily modified during construction
- **refactoring** is encouraged
	- change methods that does not alter external behavior
	- improves internal structure
	- *object-oriented programming* makes **refactoring** *easier*
	- bugs are minimized
- design occurs before and after coding commences.
- design continuously improved
