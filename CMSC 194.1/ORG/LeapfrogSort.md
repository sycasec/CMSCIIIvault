Albacea, E.A. (1995) “Leapfrogging Samplesort,” _Algorithms, Concurrency and Knowledge_, 1023, pp. 1–9. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-60688-2_30.

In this article, Albacea presents a Quicksort-based sorting algorithm that performs at $O(n(log n)^{2})$  at worst case, claiming that it is the most practical alternative to Quicksort. The author presents their analysis of the algorithm's performance at worst-case and average-case, concluding that the novel algorithm has better average comparisons and data interchanges than that required by the best implementation of Quicksort.

While this article is highly interesting in that there is a mathematical development creating more efficient sorting techniques, it unrelated to my research topic and will only serve as supplemental reading.
