Piedrahita-Valdés, H. _et al._ (2021) “Vaccine hesitancy on social media: Sentiment analysis from June 2011 to April 2019,” _Vaccines_, 9(1), p. 28. Available at: https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010028.

In this article, Valdés and colleagues scraped anonymized, vaccine-related Twitter posts from 1st June 2011 to 30th April 2019 and utilized a sentiment analysis algorithm to classify the tweets. The authors found that around 69% of the tweets were neutral, 22% was positive, and 9% was negative. Based on geolocation tags, the authors also found that negative vaccine-related tweets were most common in the Netherlands, Canada, and Japan. 

However, the authors themselves recognize the limitation of the algorithm in such that it may not be able to correctly categorize irony and/or sarcasm, which is still a challenge for both supervised and unsupervised classification methods.

While this article proves to be an interesting combination of data engineering and natural language processing, it is not directly related to my research interest and will therefore not be a basis of my research.
