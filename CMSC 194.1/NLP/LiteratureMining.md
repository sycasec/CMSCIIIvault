Frijters, R. _et al._ (2010) “Literature mining for the discovery of hidden connections between drugs, genes and diseases,” _PLoS Computational Biology_, 6(9). Available at: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943.

In this article, Frijters and colleagues described CoPub Discovery which is a tool that mines and provides analytics for literature from the CoPub Database to allow researchers to discover novel relationships between biomedical concepts. The authors then implemented statistical analytics on the performance of CoPub Discovery using ROC curves and found that it can distinguish true hidden relationships from true negatives. The authors conclude that CoPub Discovery is a robust method that can quickly detect novel associations between genes, drugs, pathways, diseases, and novel applications for existing drugs.


However the authors themselves identify points of improvement for the tool, wherein incorporation of additional evidence may be added on in the future. Additional measures of confidence for relationships of literature could also be a direction for improvement.

While this article describes a scientifically relevant application of natural language processing, it is not directly related to my research interest and will not serve as the basis of my research.
