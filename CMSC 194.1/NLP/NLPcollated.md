Frijters, R. _et al._ (2010) “Literature mining for the discovery of hidden connections between drugs, genes and diseases,” _PLoS Computational Biology_, 6(9). Available at: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000943.

In this article, Frijters and colleagues described CoPub Discovery which is a tool that mines and provides analytics for literature from the CoPub Database to allow researchers to discover novel relationships between biomedical concepts. The authors then implemented statistical analytics on the performance of CoPub Discovery using ROC curves and found that it can distinguish true hidden relationships from true negatives. The authors conclude that CoPub Discovery is a robust method that can quickly detect novel associations between genes, drugs, pathways, diseases, and novel applications for existing drugs.


However the authors themselves identify points of improvement for the tool, wherein incorporation of additional evidence may be added on in the future. Additional measures of confidence for relationships of literature could also be a direction for improvement.

While this article describes a scientifically relevant application of natural language processing, it is not directly related to my research interest and will not serve as the basis of my research.

Piedrahita-Valdés, H. _et al._ (2021) “Vaccine hesitancy on social media: Sentiment analysis from June 2011 to April 2019,” _Vaccines_, 9(1), p. 28. Available at: https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010028.

In this article, Valdés and colleagues scraped anonymized, vaccine-related Twitter posts from 1st June 2011 to 30th April 2019 and utilized a sentiment analysis algorithm to classify the tweets. The authors found that around 69% of the tweets were neutral, 22% was positive, and 9% was negative. Based on geolocation tags, the authors also found that negative vaccine-related tweets were most common in the Netherlands, Canada, and Japan. 

However, the authors themselves recognize the limitation of the algorithm in such that it may not be able to correctly categorize irony and/or sarcasm, which is still a challenge for both supervised and unsupervised classification methods.

While this article proves to be an interesting combination of data engineering and natural language processing, it is not directly related to my research interest and will therefore not be a basis of my research.

Melgo, M. V. B., & Roxas, R. R. (2018). TransPic: Using Images as Interlingua for Machine Translations Systems. _Journal of Industrial Information Technology and Application_, _2_(3), 100–109. https://doi.org/ISSN(Online) :2586-0852

In this article, Melgo and Roxas create a simplistic text-to-image generator with a pre-configured mapping of texts to images. The authors developed a simplistic Web Application with a corpus database that stores words from a website and their corresponding translations into several other languages. corresponding images are downloaded or manually made.  The WebApp allows users to log in and add, update, or delete categories and words. The authors then tested the clarity and accuracy of images by making users link images to corresponding words. The authors conclude that 82% of the images were correctly linked to corresponding pronouns, and 85% of pronouns were correctly linked to 

However, there are many limitations in this study. While included in the NLP research group, this article makes no use of artificial intelligence and relies solely on pre-mapped translations created by the authors. There is no depiction nor any in-depth description of the WebApp design and testing for image aptness was conducted without the use of the WebApp. Users are given free reign over the database, which may introduce security concerns. Finally, testing on the aptness of images only uses pronouns while the authors give baseless justification on why only pronouns are used, other than claiming that they are "*harder to understand*" and "*harder to depict into images*", both of which hinging on the credibility of the authors' words, with no proof to demonstrate.

This article is unrelated to my research interest, and will not be the basis of my research.
