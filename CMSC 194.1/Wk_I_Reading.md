#### Why is reading important?
- challenges you
- stimulates your mind

### Reading effectively
- **preview**
	- predict what you will read based on your own knowledge
- **skim**
	- pick up main ideas, get an overview of text.
	- glide over large sections and look at the headings and subheadings.
	- topic sentences / last lines of paragraphs
- **scan**
	- look for specific information & you reada text quickly
- **read deeply**
	- this comes after skim reading & after you've decided a text is relevant
	- read slowly & carefully, make notes / annotated bib

- **Task Analysis**
	- *Purpose* : Lecture preparation, Tutorial, Practice
		- ***Skim*** - to gain the main idea / overview
	- *Purpose*: Background understanding for lecture / assignment
		- ***Scan*** - to find specific detail / keyword
	- *Purpose*: Assignment research / actual evidence to include in my assignment
		- ***Close*** - repeated readings for exposition and evidence

### Reading Critically
- **surface approach to reading**
	- something that has to be done
	- meet task requirements
	- memorize information
	- principles are not distinguished from examples
	- focus on details without making connections or integrating information
	- no reflection on the purpose for reading on strategies employed

- **deep approach to reading**
	- goal is to understand
	- vigorous interaction with content
	- new ideas related ro previous knowledge
	- concepts are related to everyday experience
	- evidence related to conclusions
	- logic of arguments is examined

- **deep / intensive reading: ask questions**
	- what is the author trying to say?
	- from what perspective does the author write?
	- does what the writer say agree with other papers?
	- do you agree with what the writer is saying?
	- how do they support their claims / arguments?
	- what type of reasoning do they use? is it logical and consistent?
	- what methodology is used and what theory is developed?
	- what evidence do they present and how is it used / interpreted
	- is the argument present balanced or biased?
	- what are the writer's credentials?
	- how is the text structured?
	- how does it contribute to the field?
	- how is it relevant to your purpose? (your topic?)
