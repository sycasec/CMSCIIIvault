In this article, Zhao, Su, Lu, and Wang extracted biomedical literature and reviews recent implementations of natural language processing (NLP) models to perform crucial tasks in Biomedical Literature Mining (BLM). The article provides detailed manuscripts on the latest models pertaining to crucial tasks in BLM, such as named entity recognition (NER), named entity normalization (NEN), literature classification, relation extration (RE), pathway extraction, and finally hypothesis generation or literature-based discovery (LBD). 

The authors present the in excruciating detail the concurrent problems and challenges concerning the NLP models and studies implemented for each task. While this article is somewhat related to my research topic in that it offers insight towards the recent applications of machine learning (ML), the article heavily focuses on problems related to tasks performed in BLM. 

Since the scope of this paper is limited to problems and research interests surrounding BLM, it will not form the basis of my research. However, it is useful as supplementary information for my research since it provides relevant details on various ML methods.
