Yilmaz, O. (2021) “Augmented reality in science education: An application in Higher Education,” _Shanlax International Journal of Education_, 9(3), pp. 136–148. Available at: /doi.org/10.34293/education.v9i3.3907.

In this article, Yilmaz examines the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) integration into the learning environment using a qualitative research approach on a university-level chemistry course and concluded that AR is best suited towards supplementing the teaching of abstract subjects that may not feature direct observation and examination. The author finds that students have positive opinions in the use of AR in supplementing the learning environment. 

However, the author admits that the study is limited in the fact that its conclusions rely solely on the subjective data provided by the respondents, which reduces the reliability of the results. While the students have had positive opinions on AR, there is no indicator that the technology has factually aided the students' learning. Furthermore, the study has only applied AR to a chemistry class, which gives us relatively no data on how it would perform on different subjects.

While this article does not relate to my research topic, it is helpful in providing novel information on the integration of AR in education, providing relativel helpful inisght on the direction and applications of AR.

Zhao, S. _et al._ (2020) “Recent advances in biomedical literature mining,” _Briefings in Bioinformatics_, 22(3). Available at: /doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa057.

In this article, Zhao, Su, Lu, and Wang extracted biomedical literature and reviews recent implementations of natural language processing (NLP) models to perform crucial tasks in Biomedical Literature Mining (BLM). The article provides detailed manuscripts on the latest models pertaining to crucial tasks in BLM, such as named entity recognition (NER), named entity normalization (NEN), literature classification, relation extration (RE), pathway extraction, and finally hypothesis generation or literature-based discovery (LBD). 

The authors present the in excruciating detail the concurrent problems and challenges concerning the NLP models and studies implemented for each task. While this article is somewhat related to my research topic in that it offers insight towards the recent applications of machine learning (ML), the article heavily focuses on problems related to tasks performed in BLM. 

Since the scope of this paper is limited to problems and research interests surrounding BLM, it will not form the basis of my research. However, it is useful as supplementary information for my research since it provides relevant details on various ML methods.

Mondigo, L & Lao, D.M (2017) "E-learning for introductory computer science concept on recursion applying two types of feedback methods in the learning assessment," *Asian Association of Open Universities Journal, 12(2), pp. 218-229*.

In this article, Mondigo and Lao (2017) imeplemented a test driven development (TDD) approach in developing a web-based interactive learning object (ILO) of an introductory Computer Science (CS) concept on recursion. The authors adapted Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT) to evaluate the ILO's effectiveness as a learning tool.  Freshmen Math and CS undergraduate majors were then utilized as respondents to compare delayed and immediate feedback methods. Their conclusion is that the web-based ILO is an effective teaching tool for introductory recursion, an feedback mechanism is crucial to the learning process especially when implemented along with an ILO.

However, the author uses only 32 respondents within the university which limits the scope of the study. Furthermore, the study does not account for the possibility that CS students may have already encountered the concept of recursion, since the author simply assumes that the students have no prior knowledge. Despite this, the authors provide unique insight on how ILOs can be incoroporated in the learning process, and thus provide an improvement.

While this article does not relate to my research topic, Mondigo and Lao's work reveals the importance of feedback mechanism and interactivity to the learning process. This gives a clear picture on how technology can be applied to further improve teaching methods and knowledge retention.

Ching-Hsue C. & Chung-Ho S. 2011, “A Game-based Learnign System for improving Student's Learning Effectiveness in System Analysis Course”, *Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences 31 (2021)*, pp. 669-675

In this article, Hsue and Ho examned the effects of a game-based learning environment and information-technology on student learning capacity and improvement on self-efficacy. The authors found that incorporating course content into interactive, game-based learning and repeated self-learning provides an increase on learning interest and motivation. 

In this study, the authors use a very limited population size of 63 students which obviously limits the scope of the study. Despite this, the authors managed to provide insight on gamification of the learning process.

This article will not form the basis of my research. Nevertheless, it provides useful insight on potential research problems to tackle in the future.
