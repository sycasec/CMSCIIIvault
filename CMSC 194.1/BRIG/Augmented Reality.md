In this article, Yilmaz examines the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) integration into the learning environment using a qualitative research approach on a university-level chemistry course and concluded that AR is best suited towards supplementing the teaching of abstract subjects that may not feature direct observation and examination. The author finds that students have positive opinions in the use of AR in supplementing the learning environment. 

However, the author admits that the study is limited in the fact that its conclusions rely solely on the subjective data provided by the respondents, which reduces the reliability of the results. While the students have had positive opinions on AR, there is no indicator that the technology has factually aided the students' learning. Furthermore, the study has only applied AR to a chemistry class, which gives us relatively no data on how it would perform on different subjects.

While this article does not relate to my research topic, it is helpful in providing novel information on the integration of AR in education, providing relativel helpful inisght on the direction and applications of AR.
