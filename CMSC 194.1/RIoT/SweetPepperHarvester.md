Bac, C.W. _et al._ (2017) “Performance evaluation of a harvesting robot for Sweet Pepper,” _Journal of Field Robotics_, 34(6), pp. 1123–1139. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.21709.

In this article, Bac and his colleagues develop a robot that autonomously harvests sweet peppers in a commercial green-house, which was equipped with a Fin Ray and Lip Type end effector in separate instances. The robot's performance in correctly detecting as well as success in grasping the sweet peppers was evaluated. The authors found that the Fin Ray end effector was much more successful in grasping and cutting fruits than the Lip Type end effector.

However, the authors admitted that the robot had major issues in detecting the fruits, which was due to controllable conditions like lighting and different crop conditions. It is also worth noting that the robots can barely detect crops (6% and 2% for Fin Ray and Lip Type respectively) and was only able to improve detection rate up to   about 30% when obstructions were removed. 

While this article does not directly relate to my research topic, it is useful in providing a grasp of how computer vision systems are developed and how they are used to solve problems.
