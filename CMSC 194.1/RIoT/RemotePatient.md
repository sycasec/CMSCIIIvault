Iranpak, S., Shahbahrami, A. and Shakeri, H. (2021) “Remote Patient Monitoring and classifying using the internet of things platform combined with cloud computing,” _Journal of Big Data_, 8(1). Available at: https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00507-w.

In this article, Iranpak, Shahahrami, and Shakeri implement an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that collects patient data from wristwatch sensors. This data is then prioritized and queued into the microcontroller which encrypts and sends the data over to a mobile gateaway, ultimately sending it to a cloud server and deliver information to the patient's family. The authors evalutate this by simulating the entire process and comparing it to other methods. The authors found that their proposed method is 10.41% more accurate than the most current accurate method.

The main limitation in this article is that the accuracies of other methods as depicted by the authors relies solely on their simulation of said IoT methods which could easily be falsified or at the very least, contested. More than that, the proposed method's accuracy data relies only on the authors' simulation which could also be easily falsified or manipulated, and may not reflect real world data. 

While this article is unrelated to my research topic, it may serve a guide in following better research practices. More than that, it is interesting to know that there is constant effort in pushing the limits of IoT.
