Dhar, P. _et al._ (2021) “Augmented reality in medical education: Students’ experiences and learning outcomes,” _Medical Education Online_, 26(1). Available at: https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2021.1953953.

Dhar and colleagues review several augmented reality (AR) based educational programs and how they perform in improving medical training/education, and how they affect delivery of complex information. The authors discuss the benefits of AR technology implemented in medical education as well as its limitations as a tool used for learning and teaching medical education.

The authors point out the main limitation of AR technology which is the cost of designing interactive platforms in AR, as well as the severe lack of resources that would be required to cater to the size of the student body. While AR integrated into education is highly suggested to be a step in the right direction, the current costs simply outweight the benefits.

This article will not form the basis of my research, as it is unrelated to my research topic. The article however is helpful in the sense that the academia may expect more capable scholars with the unstopping improvement of technology integrated into education.
