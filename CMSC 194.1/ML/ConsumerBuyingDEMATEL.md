Medalla, M.E. _et al._ (2021) “Relationship mapping of consumer buying behavior antecedents of secondhand clothing with Fuzzy DEMATEL,” _Journal of Management Analytics_, 8(3), pp. 530–568. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1080/23270012.2020.1870878.

In this article, Medalla and colleagues review existing literature and identify several antecedents  to consumer buying behavior on second hand clothing (SHC). The authors invited 15 "experts" in SHC, all of which are 25-38 years old SHC buyers and users. These "experts" are asked to determine the influence of previously identified antecedents ins SHC buying. The authors then adopted a Fuzzified DEMATEL method to determine causal relationships between these antecedents based on the responses of "experts". The authors have concluded that the primary cause for SHC buying fall under *critical motivation*, and the primary effect is *economic motivation*.

A limitation easy toidentify within this article is the credibility of "experts", where no seller was invited, being utilized as determinants in influence of antecedents. The results of the study then rely heavily on the opinions of said "experts". Furthermore, the article's conclusions are vague enough that they simply supplement obvious facts, such as wanting to buy SHC because of certain motivations.

While this study is an interesting application of computational intelligence as a supplement to the analysis of market trend and consumer behavior, this study will not be the basis of my research because i find that my interest lies elsewhere.
