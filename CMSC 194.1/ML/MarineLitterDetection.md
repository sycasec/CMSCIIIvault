Garcia-Garin, O. _et al._ (2021) “Automatic detection and quantification of floating marine macro-litter in aerial images: Introducing a novel deep learning approach connected to a web application in R,” _Environmental Pollution_, 273, p. 116490.

In this article, Garin and colleagues developed a deep-learning model that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify floating marine macro-litter (FMML) in aerial images of sea surfaces. The model was trained from aerial images obtained from photographic surveys performed by drones and manned aircraft between 2017 to 2019 over the Balearic Sea close to the shores of Spain. The authors then developed a Web Application to allow users to upload aerial images for the model to analyze. The authors found that the F1-score of their model was 8 points better than the best currently existing model.

The limitations in this article, as the authors themselves have identified, are related to the problems of computer vision. The authors found that environmental variables such as sun glint and sea surface perturbation introduces problems within the aerial images. 

This article presents an interesting application of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence towards the goal of bringing positive environmental change. However, this article does not specifically align with my research interest, and will serve as additional related literature.
