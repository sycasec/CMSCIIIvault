# TechnoCulture

### GOAL:
#### Provide Definition for Techno Culture
#### Describe how it is framed in the article

## Abstract
> This article argues that the term *technoculture* is frequently used in a wooly manner to refer in a general way to technologies implemented in Western cultures, and to constructions of culture that incorporate technological aspects. The opportunity for the term to convey a specific meaning is lost in the generality of this everyday usage.
> Arguing from first principles about the nature of technology and culture, the paper suggests that techonoculture as a term should be applied to communications technologies that are used in the medaited construction of culture. To be *technocultural*, the technology concerned must facilitate cultural communication across space and/or time and should, in some way, raise issues of place.
> Since culture is a construction involving communication and more tahn one person, technoculture involves the communication of cultural material in technological contexts - which is to say, other than the face-to-face. If this definition were to be adopted, future discussions of technoculture would indicate reference to a technology that allows the construction of culture across space and time.

#### Summarized by me
The article argues that the term *technoculture* as a term has lost its meaning due to misusage and ubiquity, and thus puts forwards that technoculture should refer to the intermingling of technology and culture in such that the technology involved must be a factor or means of transmission and/or construction of culture through space and time, involve more than one person, and if possible, not face to face (online).


## Long Form
### Intro (background tc)
- used with increasing frequency in cultural studies
- popping off in social and cultural debates
- in the book *Technoculture*, Penley and Ross discuss forms of resistance where technology and culture have been harnessed to challenge the status quo
	- implies that *technoculture* is associated with the action of technological/power/cultural elites. 
	- compared to **when this paper was made**, it is difficult to recognize the 1991 definition to refer to the same subjects and issues.
	- the author (paper) **argues** that it **should be tha same**

- paper starts argument that the term needs investigation by claiming that the social construction of the *technoculture* indicates that *tech* and *culture* are **closely related**
- paper points out the dispute of the term *technology*
	- points out that language is considered *technology*
		- if so, any aspect of human culture is also technology.
	- claims that we tend not to think of language as *techno* (no source)
		- *tech* is more frequently applied to innovative *high-tech* tech
		- claims that language is self-evidently cultural. (no source)
- points out that high tech implies existence of low tech
	- cites source that says having the latest piece of tech signals "*being involved in directing the future*"
	- compares this to use of female illiteracy as dominance, gatekeeping tech then is a form of preserving dominance (cited source)
	- compares this kind of stuff to how medieval church used convoluted latin
- paper drives the "language is tech" point home by demonstrating how hebrew readers would think compared to later language readers (cited source)
- cites source that argues that contextualizing the term *technology* will allow us to properly define it, because it is too broad.
	- says  that it is both *fish* and *water*,*means* as well as *end*. (couldnt have found better terms)

- paper cites different ways culture has been explained

because paper has discussed how technological can be cultural and how cultural can be viewed as technological, paper demonstrates this in saying that calling electricity as *technocultural* is no different than calling a bikini a cottage garden, a batik company, synchronized swimming the same.

#### Main argument
paper then argues that the internet is the best example of technoculture
- the term *technoculture* should not be used for all tech created through human cultur.
- only for tech where cultural material is created and circulated using tech mediated communication (recursion)
- the electricity, car, fridge are not technoculture (though they may enable)
- the language , the phone, the book, films, tv, internet, are technocultural
- **Technoculture, as a class of technologies, involve mediated communication.**

- communities on the internet (reddit, discord) can be constructed as being both 100% tech and 100% culture, both fish and water.
- claims that internet is hightech, and that it is difficult to find discussions in the internet that are not *future oriented* (recall source that says having high tech means directing the future)
- argues that internet culture is real culture operating in virtual space

- the paper rehashes its main argument - technoculture must refer to technology that allows the perpetuation, transmission, and creation of culture. 
> the term has the capacity to refer specifically to technologies that facilitate cacommunication through which culture is constructed.

- finalizes that written language is technology (as defined above) but spoken is not (because it lacks the through space and time aspect)
-
