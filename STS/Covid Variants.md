COVID or viruses in general, multiply by copying their genomes over and over. but these copies aren't always perfect. Each of these imperfect copies is a variant.

While it is rare for important mutations like becoming more infectious or becoming more capable of avoiding the immune system, the rapid replication of viruses allows it to generate mutated replicants very fast. 

The more viruses are allowed to replicate unchecked, it becomes more likely that it accumulates these rare beneficial mutations over time. 

Epidemiology can help detect and trace new variants while flag novel or worrying patterns of infection Lab studies can help pinpoint how mutations change the properties of the virus. 

Several mutations in the coronavirus like the D614G affects the spike protein making the new variant more infectious.

Mutation N501Y is another spike protein mutation that appears to be associated with increased transmissibility. 

However, studies show that the coronavirus is actually mutating very slowly, compared to something like the influenza. 

Scientists are still taking the threat of new variants seriously though, and research efforts are continually directed towards monitoring and tracing emergence of variants, with global organizations working on sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. 

Next, researchers need to study how these variants could affect global vaccination efforts, pushing to redesign and combine vaccines to combat variants of concern. 

Public health policies such as track and trace, social distancing, and vaccine roll-outs remain to be the most effective methods of mitigating virus transmission and keep tabs on new variants.


After all, when viruses are prevented from spreading, they are also prevented from mutating, nipping new, dangerous variants in the bud.
