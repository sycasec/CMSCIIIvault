Reach Chapter 3 - What is Reality? of the book The Grand by Hawking and Mlodinow and try to answer the following study questions:  
  
1. How did classical science define the physical world?  
2. What is the limitation of this definition of the physical world?  
3. How did modern science expound on the definition of the physical world?  
4. What are the elements of a good model?

# What is Reality?

## How did classical science define the physical world?  
- there exists a real external world whose properties are definite and independent of the observer who perceives them
	- certain objects exists and have physical properties
	- our measurements and perceptions correspond to them
	- observer and observed are parts of a world that has an objective existence
	- any distinction between observer and observed has no meaningful significance
		- if you see a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage, it is because that is real.
		- object permanence - anyone who observes them will notice the exact same properties, and those properties will persist whether or not it is observed.
		- this belief is called realism
- quantum physics
	- particle has neither definite position nor velocity until (measured) observed
		- therefore *not correct* to say that (measurement) observation gives us certainty on the properties of the object (because it will change once no longer observed and while being observed)
- anti-realists
	- argue that observation and experiment are meaningful *but*
	- theories are no more useful instruments that do not embody any deeper truths underlying the observed phenomena
		- meaning that theories are bullshit
- David Hume
	- although we have no rational grounds for believing in an objective reality, we also have no choice but to act as if it is true
- model dependent realism
	- pointless to ask whether a model is real, only whether it agrees with observation
	- if there are two models that agree with observation, one cannot say that one is more real than the other
	- our observation of reality is created through our sensory processing and the way we think and reason
		- observations upon which our theories are based are shaped by the interpretative framework of our brains
		- this means that our view of reality is similar to that of the curved bowl of the goldfish, only that the bowl is our framework of reasoning
	- the brain interprets vision
		- because eyes are literally like weird lenses
		- the brain corrects the image and creates a 3D model from the 2D data transmitted by the eyes

## What is the limitation of this definition of the physical world? 

## How did modern science expound on the definition of the physical world?  

## What are the elements of a good model?
- Is elegant
- Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements
- agrees with and explains all existing observations
- makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out

- these criteria are obviously subjective
- elegance of a theory is closely related to the lack of adjustable elements 
	- a theory jammed with fudge factors is not very elegant
- a theory should be as simple as possible but not simpler - Einstein
- when a model is found lacking, some physicists attempt to save the model by modifying it
	- when the theory is modified to the degree that alterations are cumbersome, it becomes *“inelegant”*
