The Origin of life
- What were the contributions of the following to models of the origin of life on Earth:
	- Oparin and Haldane
	- Miller and Urey
In 1920 Aleksandr Oparin and J.B.S Haldane, although working independently, developed a theory that life began from primordial soup of prebiotic Earth’s ocean, a reductive environment without molecular oxygen. From this environment, with the help of an immense energy source such as raw Ultraviolet rays from the sun unhindered by the lack of an ozone layer or electrical discharge - hypothesizing that simple organic compounds were eventually formed such as amino acids, which eventually gave rise to more complex polymers. In 1953 Stanley Miller and Harold Urey tested this theory with a mixture of hydrogen molecule H$_2$ ,  water H$_2$O, ammonia NH$_3$, and methane CH$_4$, to mimic the reducing atmosphere, electrical discharge to simulate lightning as an energy source, closed in a glass vessel for about a week. They were able to collect a solution that contained water-soluble organic compounds, including several amino acids (components of proteins) and other biochemically significant compounds (hydroxy acids, aldehydes, and hydrogen cyanide which are simple organic compounds or monomers). This generated excitement since amino acids are known to be the building blocks of life, proving the plausibility of abiogenesis as the origin of life on Earth. However, this is still debatable as there is still a lack of direct evidence on what exactly is the composition and conditions of early Earth atmosphere. Other plausible theories must also be considered as they could have also happened along with this process, such as the panspermia theory.

- What are protobionts and microspheres, and what does their existence imply about how cellular life began?
Aleksandr Oparin theorized that life developed from coacervates which spontaneously formed microscopic globular structures of lipid molecules that ranged in size from 1 to 500 micra in diameter. A coacervate is a specific type of protobiont or proto-cell, which is an aggregate of simple organic molecules, that display some characteristic of life. A microsphere is a type of proto-cell, just like the coacervate. Thery form spontaneously when liquid water is added to abiotically produced polypeptides, can grow, divide, and maintain internal chemistry different from their surroundings. Proto-cells are believed to be the precursor to prokaryotes due to their absence of internal membranes, ultimately giving impeccable plausibility to abiogenesis as the origin of life on Earth.

- What were the consequences of an *oxygenated* Earth to life and to the atmosphere itself?
- What model for WHERE life began (not *how*) seems to be highly unlikely, and which model is the most probable? (explain briefly)
### activity notes
- to help with the last question, do some research on different models
	- think about whether the model can be tested in the lab or can be observed physically
	- is there any proof/evidence that life is present in this area?
	- cite sources


## Notes - Mod 9 - Origin of the Biosphere
### Introduction
- Recon missions to other planets in inner solar system shows no life in these planets (barren landscapes)
- Biosphere - the place where all Earth’s life dwells, is blue and green in color (the exact opposite of barren)
	- the term was invented by Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to describe:
		- the atmosphere of gas
		- the hydrosphere of oceans, lakes, rivers, springs, and other waters
		- the lithosphere of solid rock surface of the outer portion of the earth (crust)
	- It was Vladimir I. Verandsky (Russian crystalographer) that popularized the term with his book “The Biosphere (1926).”
		- in the book, he outlines his view of life as a major geological force
		- “Living matter erodes, levels, transports, and chemically transforms surface rocks, minerals, and other features of the Earth.“ (Vernadsky quoted by Sagan et al., 2020) 
  ### Formation of biomolecules under primitive earth conditions 
- living organisms at their base form, cells, have existed for billions of years.
- currently the most dominant explanation
- each cell has come from the division of existing cell
	- where did the first cell come from?
- most scientists think cells arose from hundreds of millions of years of chance chemical events and selection preserved in the course of evolution
- the absence of molecular oxygen O$_2$ or oxygen gas in a reducing atmosphere is one of the basic conditions for life to begin
	  - oxygen would have combined with early organic molecules and destroyed them quickly
	  - no chance to form more complex structures
#### four conditions for current chemical evolution model to be met in early earth:
- little to no molecular oxygen O$_2$
- abundant energy sources (volcanism, thunderstorms, particle bombardment)
	- sun was hotter with more UV
	- Earth had no ozone layer to filter most of the UV light coming in
- appropriate chemicals such as chemical building blocks of water various dissolved inorganic ions, atmospheric gases
- lots and lots of time
### Hypotheses explaining the origin of life
- most fundamental and least understood biological problem
- central to many philosophical and scientific debates, especially the consideration of extraterrestrial life
#### most hypotheses fall into four categories
- “The Divine Hypothesis”
	- origin of life result of supernatural event - beyond physics, chemistry, and science.
- “Spontaneous Generation”
	- simple life spontaneously arises from non-living matter in short periods of time
	- dominant for centuries
	- finally put to rest when Louis Pasteur showed that heating / sterilizing (Pasteurization) could kill microorganisms present, the sterile substance was protected from air
- “Panspermia”
	- microscopic lifeforms that can survive the effects of space were brought to Earth via smaller bodies in the solar system
	- asteroid cum
- “abiogenesis”
	- life arose on early Earth through a series of progressive chemical reactions

### Lab experiments to demonstrate feasibility of abiogenesis
- 1920s British geneticist J.B.S Haldane and Russian biochemist Aleksandr Oparin 
	- proposed that organic molecules could form spontaneously form simpler raw materiasls (inorganic) 
	- if sufficient energy (UV or lightning discharge) is supplied in a reducing (energy-rich, electron adding) environment 
	- with “building blocks” like amino acids forming first, combining to make complex polymers
- life evolved in the oceans during a period when the atmosphere was reducing with H$_2$ , H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$, no free oxygen molecules (O$_2$).
- replicated in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey
	- mixture of hydrogen molecule H$_2$ ,  water H$_2$O, ammonia NH$_3$, and methane CH$_4$, to mimic the reducing atmosphere
	- subjected to electric discharge to simulate lightning
	- in a closed gas vessel for about a week
	- Collected solution contained water-soluble organic compounds, including several amino acids (components of proteins)
	- and other biochemically significant compounds (hydroxy acids, aldehydes, and hydrogen cyanide which are simple organic compounds or monomers) 
	- The results generated much excitement since amino acids are known as building blocks of proteins which in turn are building blocks of living organisms.


- Some scientists support the **RNA world hypothesis**
	- first life was self-replicating RNA.
- others favor the **metabolism-first hypothesis**
	- networking smaller molecules contained in simple capsules akin to cell membranes before DNA or RNA
	- chicken and egg paradox - no proteins without DNA to code for them, no reason for DNA without proteins to code for.
- DNA could not have risen without protein, as their symbiosis is far too complex.
- Most likely RNA before DNA + protein
	- RNA looks a lot like DNA but single stranded
	- RNA is a molecule that carries information like DNA, but can also fold itself into complex 3D shapes like proteins
		- RNAs can be their own enzymes (proteins)
	- since RNA is ribonucleic acid, can act like an enzyme, these primordial RNA are called *ribozymes*
		- *most important candidate for the origin of life*
- However, RNA cannot be easily synthesized under primordial earth conditions, 
- how they were naturally formed remains a problem unsolved

- Scientists agree on the basic requirements for the origin of life
- debate on the exact steps involved and significance of some experimental results
- the focus of above experiments are simple organic compounds
- some scientists think life originated in hydrothermal vents on the seafloor

### Models for where life on earth began
- Miller and Urey theorized that lightning could generate amino acids and sugars from atmosphere that has no molecular oxygen
	- loaded with water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen (composition of early seas?)
- their predecessor Haldane and them, thought life started from hot ocean during a period when the atmosphere was reducing
- the prebiotic broth states that life began from an organic soup in the oceans
- Alexander Graham Cairns Smith porposed that first molecules first generated in clay
	- surfaces pooled organic compounds, helped organized into gene like patterns
	- organic molecules took over this job and organized themselves
 
- another view is that ice might have covered the oceans 3 bya since the sun was about a third less luminous than it is now
- possibly hundreds of feet thick layers of ice might have protected fragile organic compounds in the water below from UV and cosmic impacts
	- molecules survived longer, allowing a long series of chemical selection to happen

- life could have come from outside of earth
- exogenesis suggests that aliens came all over the place (extraterrestrial source, not necessarily aliens)
	- also known as panspermia (get it, aliens came all over the place)
	- the seeds of life are everywhere, microbial life on Earth *came* from another planet, another star system
	- evolved into the multitudes of species we have today.
- idea was strengthened after the revelation that tardigrades survived exzposure to harsh environment of space on an Earth-orbiting mission travelling between planets
### Models for how the first cells could have functioned
- Although haldane and oparin were independently working, both believed in abiogenesis
	- primitive organic molecules, reducing environment, strong energy source (UV, lightning)
- both also suspected that the first life-forms appeared in the warm, primitive ocean and were heterotrophic
	- obtaining nutrients from the primitive Earth environment
- not autotrophic
	- generating food from sunlight or inorganic materials

- Oparin believed that life developed from coacervates
	- spontaneously formed microscopic globular structures of lipid molecules that ranged in size from 1 to 500 micra in diameter
	- enclosed in double-layer membrane, held together by electrostatic forces
	- precursors to cells as we know them now
		- coacervates can grow, when reaching a certain dimension (length x width x height), divide to form smaller globules
- oparin’s work with coacervates showed that 
	- enzymes needed for metabolism functioned more efficiently when contained within membrane-bound spheres 
	- rather than free in aqueous solutions
- Haldane, believed that simple organic molecules including amino acids formed first
	- under the presence of UV, they became increasingly complex, eventually forming cells

- Miller and Urey tested the Oparin-Haldane theory
	- successfully produced organic molecules from some of the inorganic components thought to have been present in prebiotic earth

- In some modern metabolism-based models of abiogenesis, Oparin’s coacervates were incoroporated
	- steady progression from simple organic molecules was suggested, specifically protobionts
	- **Protobionts** are aggregates of organic molecules that display some characteristics of life.
		- Microspheres, a type of protobiont, form spontaneously when liquid water is added to abiotically produced polypeptides.
		- Microspheres can grow, divide, and maintain internal chemistry different from their surroundsings
		- Protobionts presumably gave rise to prokaryotes because of the absence of internal membranes
		-
