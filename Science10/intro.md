## Introduction
- physical geology examines earth composition, understand geological processes
- historical geology seeks to understand the origin of the earth, development through time
	- establish an orderly, chronological arrangement of the multitude of physical and biological changes that have occurred since
	- deals with the sequence of events in the earth’s history as it can be interpreted from evidence found in rocks such as:
		- deposition of sedimentary strata
		- geographical distributions of land and sea
		- conditions of climate and terrain
		- animals and plants  in lands and seas (old)
		- dates and locations of crustal movements which have disturbed the pattern of quiet sedimentation

### Doctrine of Catastrophism
- porposed by French zoologist Baron Georges Cuvier 1769-1832
- between 17th → 18th centuries, strongly influenced the formulation of explanations about earth dynamics
- catastrophists believed that the earth’s landscapes have been primarily shaped by great catastrophies (sudden, violent worldwide disasters)
- length of time needed for events in geologic time was grossly underestimated by catastrophists
### Principle of Uniformitarianism
- 18th century when James Hutton (1726-1797), scottish physician and farmer published Theory of the Earth
- popularized by Charles Lyell’s book, Principles of Geology (1830)
- 18th century generally regarded as beginning of modern geology
## Geologic Time
- geologists use two different frames of reference when discussing geologic time
### Relative Dating 19th century
- absolute dating was still unavailable
- placing geologic events in sequential order as determined by their position in geologic record 
- unable to determine how long ago a particular event took place, only that one event preceded the other
- sequence of eons, eras, periods, and epochs, but no numbers indicating how long ago each of these periods occurred.
### Absolute Dating 20th century
- gives specific dates for events, and materials expressed in years before present
- radiometric dating - most common method to obtain absolute dates which are calculated from the natural rates of decay of various natural radioactive elements present in trace amounts in some rocks
## Principle of Uniformitarianism Deep Dive
- basic part of modern geology which states that:
	- Present day processes have operated throughout geologic time, and with enough time, small changes will have tremendous effects.
- the physical laws that operate today also operated in the past
- summarized in a statement by James Hutton “the present holds the key to the past” *cringe*
- Charles Lyell: English geologist given the most credit for advancing the basic principles of modern geology
	- published 11 editions of his great work: “Principles of Geology”
- while processes are the same (in past as today), not always the same relative importance nor precisely the same rate
- acceptance of uniformitarianism meant acceptance of very long history of earth (lmao @christians)
	- although rates may vary in intensity, very long time to create or destroy major features of landscapes
	- examples: 
		- rocks containing sea fossils (+15mya) are now parts of mountains 3000m above sea level
			- mountains uplifted at a rate of 0.2mm/yr
		- rates of erosion in the North American continent lowered at a rate of 3 cm per 1000 yrs
	- may appear very long, but short in context of geologic time
## Relative Dating Laws/Principles/Methods
### Principle / Law of Superposition
- Nicolas Steno (1638-1686)
- most basic principle in relative dating
- geologic principle stating that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each bed is younger than the bed beneath, but older than the bed above
	- example: in the walls of the Grand Canyon, each strata exposed is arranged in orders of decreasing age of deposit from bottom to the top
	- same can be said for the walls of Zion Canyon and Bryce Canyon
- problems:
	- instances where strata have been bodily overturned during mountain building (orogeny) and the uppermost beds are therefore actually the oldest
	- does not tell whether the amount at which successive strata differ in age
		- we cannot tell which one of the canyons show the oldest series of strata because of differences in geographical location
### Principle of original horizontality
- goes with law of superposition
- layers of sediment are generally deposited in horizontal position
- if rock layers are positioned otherwise, must have been moved into that position via crustal disturbances sometime after their deposition
### Principle of  lateral continuity
- used to correct the second problem of law of superposition
- to develop geological time scale applicable to entire earth, rocks of similar age in different regions matched up
- to ascertain strata in two localities, travel from one point to the other, examine strata continuously as you travel
- used to prove the similarity of age, may not be applicable when the continuity of the bed is interrupted
- combination of continuity and superposition: can be used where strata have been partly removed from a region by erosion
	- travel across the country, determine relative ages of rock strata in widely separated places
	- used to prove grand canyon rocks older than zion canyon
		- both older than bryce canyon
	- grand canyon → zion → bryce (old → young)
- problems
	- sufficient over short distances, not adequate for great distances
### Principle of cross-cutting relationships (overlap law)
- igneous intrusion or fault or magma that intrudes other rocks and hardens must be younger than rocks intruded
### Principle of inclusions
- Xenoliths or fragments or eroded fragments of rocks struck in another rock are older than the rock itself
	- granite inclusions in sandstone are older than sandstone
	- 
### Principle of fossil succession
- if above principles not applicable, use this
- usable if areas compared are widely separated (i.e., between continents)
- paleontology: study of ancient life forms based upon fossils
- principle of fossil succession: fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and determinable order
	- any time period can be recognized by its fossil content
	- sedimentary strata in widely separated areas can be identified by distinctive fossil content
- shows progressive changes from simple to complex
- reveal advancement of life through time
- paleontologists look for short lived, widely distributed fossils to use as *index fossils* such as trilobytes
- Age of Trilobytes recognized early in the fossil record (abundant in cambrain seas and serves as index fossils)
	- recognized age of fishes
	- age of reptiles
	- age of mammals
- ages pertain to groups especially plentiful and characteristic during particular time periods
## Absolute Dating Methods
- previous principles help geologist place rocks and events correctly in relative age, but no absolute age in terms of years ago
- establish geologic ages in fixed time scale: expressed in years before present time, based on radiometric methods
- began soon after discovery of radioactive decay process in the elements of minerals and rocks (beginning of 20th century)
- development of new, accurate, geological clock
- geologic clock - finds the radiometric age of rocks in years by measuring radioactive decay of unstable elements in crystals of certain minerals
### Atom as basis of radiometric dating
- radioactive isotopes - forces that bind protons and neutrons together are not strong enough, nuclei spontaneously break apart (decay)
- radioactive decay - atomic nucleus spontaneously decays into nucleus of different element
	- disintegration is spontaneous
	- goes on at steady rate unaffected by external conditions
	- half-life: time required for one-half of the nuclei in a sample to decay; common way to express the rate of decay
	- parent: original radioactive isotope
	- daughter products: resulting isotopes from continuous decay
### Radiometric dating
- potassium, uranium and thorium are examples often included in minerals of rocks (used for dating)
### Uranium method
- found in mineral uraninite
- continually gives off elementary particles
	- disintegrates to form two much more common elements
	- spontaneous and continuous and isolated
	- once formed within a rock, serves as a perpetual clock
	- quantity of lead and helium produced by uranium decay steadily increases, while uranium steadily decreases
- with each year of a time a given mass of uranium produces 1/7,600,000,00 of its own mass in lead
- by measuring the amount of lead vs amount of uranium, rate may be applied to give an age in years for the mineral crystal itself
- problem
	- rock must have uranium bearing minerals
	- usually igneous rocks
	- method not generally acceptable for sedimentary layer except by relations in terms of relative age
### Potassium Argon
- most rocks have potassium
- volcanic rocks - individual crystals cannot be separated, whole rock analyzed
- measure accumulation of argon from decomposition of potassium
- problem:
	- argon, being an inert gas, does not leach out of a mineral and is easy to measure in small samples
	- great care must be taken to not subject sample to heat
- viable for dating very old rocks (4B years old) 
- old volcanic rocks, archaeological objects
### Carbon-14 method
- suitable for rocks up to 40,000 years 
	- deposits left by the last advance of ice in the pleistocene epoch
	- via techniques, may date up to 75,000 years
- problem:
	- applicable only to organic matter
	- sample must contain wood, bone, or carbonate minerals
	- can be applied to young sediments
