In *Hikalimtan* by Vicente Ranudo (1906), the suitor immediately establishes that the lady in question despises him, and yet the suitor expresses grief as he recounts his efforts of trying to forget about the lady. The suitor then proceeds to shower the lady with praise and sweet nothings, going to extremes of characterizing the lady as his personal goddess, which he adores and worships in silence within in his heart. The suitors main argument is that he cannot expunge his burning passion for this lady, followed up immediately by the timeless classic "*buot kong maimo ang tanang mga hiyas*, *ang tanang nga kaputli*" (Ranudo, 1906, stanza 11), the stars in the sky, empty extremes that will never come true anyway. It is actually disappointing that this courting tactic is a century old and you can still witness it in 2000's filipino films, dramas, and others. The suitor then ends with another classic sad-boy gaslighting maneuver where apparently the suitor is left with nothing if he is unable to have the lady's hand. While this maybe a classical piece (being a century old) I cannot help but feel insincerity from the suitors words upon the mention of his percieved *kalig-on* and how the suitor has become a metaphorical *slave* (Ranudo, 1906, stanza 9) in his desire for the lady. While the poem does not belittle the woman's intelligence, the woman is still belittled in the fact that she is called *Inday* (Ranudo, 1906, stanza 13), which I believe is a term not unrelated to inferiority.


The end of the poem leads me to believe that it is actually ironic, in the sense that the author devotes 13 stanzas to worshipping the woman and wishing to give her everything this world can offer and claiming to have become a slave to her charms, and yet the final stanza paints a very clear picture of how the woman is treated like an object. "*Kon daw buot ka nga dili simbahon // Iuli sa langit ang imong panagway*" (Ranudo, 1906, stanza 14) tells us that suitor is obsessed with her looks, and wishes that if he cant have her then no one else should. This is a very good plot twist that I would rate 8/10, wherein the poem basically tells us a tale of an obsessive suitor from the early 20th Century. While it is predictable because of how the suitor expressed extreme desire for the woman, it deserves its merit as this is a dated piece.

Fernando Buyser's *Yamog* (1938) while short, offers masterful display of allowing the reader to capture the value placed upon the drop of *yamog* as it is pierced by the early sunlight. The persona in the poem speaks about how the dew to him represesented a youthful life full of potential, hopes and dreams, "*Naglarawan sa kinabuhing batan-on // kining maanyag ug labing masigang yamog*" and how it suddenly descends to the grave (Buyser, 1938, lines 5-8). To me, *Yamog* represents the death of the persona's youth, filled with joy, warmth, and hope for the future and how it suddenly all came crashing as the persona matured to adulthood and opened their eyes to the realities of the world. The persona then basks in the melancholic coldness of the night as he sees the beauty and brightness of his forlorn dreams- "*labing siga ug matahum tun-og nga mutya // Didto sa kahitas-an may usa ka Bituon // nga sama sa katin-aw sa nawalang himaya*" (Buyser, 1938, lines 12-14) -in a single star in heaven, so beautiful, so bright, yet so far out of reach. It reminds me of the classic *Tears in rain* monologue, where the character's life flashes before their eyes and a heavy melancholy sets the scene (Scott, 1982). 


Both poems heavily display the characteristics of romantic tendency, as demonstrated in Ranudo's secularity in *Hikalimtan* (1906) in stanza 13, "*Akong Bathala sinimba sa tago*". Fernando Buyser also exemplifies this in *Yamog* (1938) in the poem's display of individuality and how the persona laments over unreachable dreams (my interpretation).
