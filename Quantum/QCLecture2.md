## Math Preliminaries
### Vectors
- Physics
	- quantity with direction and magnitude
- CS 
	- array of numbers (or any data really)
- Abstract math
	- object or entity that can be added together or multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind

- magnitude or length of vector v is given by
	- $|v| = \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}$
- dot product
	- ![[Pasted image 20231021172736.png|475]]
