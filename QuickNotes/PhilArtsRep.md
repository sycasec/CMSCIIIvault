## Modernism
an excerpt from Art and Society by Alice G. Guillermo
- In 1928, modernism was introduced into the country with Victorio Edades’ homecoming exhibit at the Philippine Columbian Club. 
	- what is the Philippine Columbian Club?
	- Who is Victorio Edades?
		- **Victorio Candido Edades** (December 23, 1895 – March 7, 1985), painter
		- He led the revolutionary Thirteen Moderns, who engaged their classical compatriots in heated debate over the nature and function of art.
			- Who are the Thirteen Moderns?
		- He was named a National Artist in 1976.
		- The history names Victorio Edades as “the father of Modern Philippine art"
		- He argued that art can be more than representation of reality, it can be representation of reality as seen through the mind and emotions of the artist.
			- Expressionism?
				- Expressionism is a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Northern Europe around the beginning of the 20th century. 
				- Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas.
				- sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality.
				- The style extended to a wide range of the arts, including expressionist architecture, painting, literature, theatre, dance, film and music.
			- He never made it to the world list of Famous Expressionists

		- In 1928, he came back to the Philippines, claims that art has receded into artists copying each other with a technique that mostly followed the works of Fernando Amorsolo
		- He mounted a one-man exhibit of 30 paintings at the Philippine Columbia Club in Ermita to show what modern art is.
		- However not one painting was sold, and this was also his peak in his career.
		- lengthy compiled archive about Edades’ views and what he fought for

	- Who Are the Thirteen Moderns?
		- Based on speculation, but since there are accounts of Carlos “Botong” Francisco and Galo B. Ocampo being the “Triumvirate” of modern art in the Philippines, it eventually grew to become a 13-strong “champions” of Modern Art:
			- Galo B. Ocampo
			- Carlos V. Francisco (National Artist, 1973)
			- Vicente Manansala (National Artist, 1981) 
			- Hernando R. Ocampo (National Artist, 1991) 
			- Cesar Legaspi (National Artist, 1990) 
			- Demetrio Diego 
			- Diosdado Lorenzo 
			- José Pardo 
			- Ricarte Purugganan 
			- Bonifacio Cristobal 
			- Arsenio Capili 
			- Anita Magsaysay-Ho. 
		- Their continued practice of Modern Art lead to the development of the PAG and AAP 
		- 
- After the war, with the founding of the Philippine Art Gallery and the Art Association of the Philippines, the support system for art, especially modernist art, was laid down along with the broadening of the base of art lovers and patrons. 
	- What is the Philippine Art Gallery?
		- **Formation of the Philippine Art Gallery**: In 1951, Fernando Zobel, a member of the Thirteen Moderns, founded the Philippine Art Gallery in Manila. The gallery aimed to provide a platform for Filipino artists to exhibit their works, particularly those exploring modernist styles. Through exhibitions and events hosted by the Philippine Art Gallery, modernist artworks gained greater visibility and recognition in the Philippine art scene.
	- What is the Art Association of the Philippines?
		- 
- The rise of political consciousness in the 60’s and 70’s that came with massive protests against the Vietnam War, the economic crisis, and the U.S. bases created a climate of political ferment that was reflected in the various arts, including painting, music, and theater. 
	- examples?
- This period saw the emergence of social and political themes in the visual arts, a trend that was led by the Social Realists. 
	- examples?
- However, the building boom during the Marcos period and the cultural projects and patronage of Imelda Marcos stimulated the art market and encouraged art catering to interior designers.
