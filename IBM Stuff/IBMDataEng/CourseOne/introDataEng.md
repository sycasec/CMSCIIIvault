## Basics
- the value we derive from data depends on:
	- the accuracy of data
	- accessibility of data
- this is the job of the data engineer
- the fastest growing job

**Learn about**
- Data
- Data Repositories
- Data Pipelines
- Data Integration Platforms
- Big Data
- Data Platform Architecture
- Data Stores
- Extract Transform-Clean (ETL, ELT)
- Data Security
- Privacy
- Compliance Regs

## Modern Data Ecosystem
**Entities**
- Interconnected
- Independent
- Continually Evolving

*Includes*
- Data integrated from disparate sources
- different types of analysis and skills to generate insights
- active stakeholders to colalborate and act on insights generated
- tools, apps, structs to store, process, disseminate data

### Data Sources
- unstructured
- structured
	- texts
	- images
	- videos
	- clickthroughs
	- user conversations (they are reading our messages)
	- professional data agencies (oh my god)
	- legacy db's

### what do with data
**PULL A COPY OF SOURCE TO DATA REPO**
- *acquire the data you need*
	- work with data formats, sources, and interfaces
	- challenges:
		- reliability of data
		- security =
		- integrity  =
- *once collected, clean data*
	- organize
	- optimize
	- conform to compliance standards
	- challenges:
		- data management
		- make sure your repo can handle the fuckton requests
- *data now used by fucking data scientists*
	- i guess i gotta build the fucking API and interfaces for these nerds too
	- what can they do without their pwetty little buttons :(((((((((
	- **Data Analysts** - may need raw data
	- **Business Stakeholders** - may need reports
	- **Apps** - API

### Tech that shape the modern data ecosystem
- Cloud tech
- ML
- Big Data
